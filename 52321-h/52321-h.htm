<p class="drop-cap">It is a habit with the citizens of old Essex, one
of the pioneer counties of the grand old Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, to point with
pride to the fact that since the earliest days of
the settlement, she was ever ready to take up arms at the
country's call, and her sons were always found ready and
willing to go forth to do battle for what they believed to
be the right.</p>

<p>The record of her soldiers and sailors is a splendid one,
and her sons have nobly represented her on land and on
sea. It is perhaps a far cry from the early days of the
settlement to the opening of hostilities in the last conflict
at arms in which the men of the county figured.</p>

<p>In the earlier events the hazards of warfare were perhaps
more, but on the other hand, in those days it was
necessary for all men able to handle a gun to fight, while
in the recent clash at arms the men who answered their
country's call volunteered their services, seeking the privilege
of bearing arms rather than having the duty forced
upon them. Honor to them all, not only for "what they
did, but all they dared."</p>

<p>Massachusetts has furnished her full quota of men at
every call of the country. Old Essex has given her share,
and as one of the Essex Regiments, the Eighth has figured
on several occasions.</p>

<p>Of those previous to 1898 this volume has no detailed
account to present, but it is a matter of pride to the
citizens of this county that it is said of the Eighth Massachusetts
that it was the first National Guard regiment
ready, after a canvass of its officers and men, to volunteer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and was one of the first to leave the state in the service of
the nation in the conflict with Spain.</p>

<p>The call to arms on this occasion did not come unexpectedly.
For some months events had been so shaping
themselves that it was evident to all close observers of
national affairs that a conflict was almost inevitable, and
the government had been placing itself in a position to
enable the country to acquit itself creditably when the
clash came.</p>

<p>War has been declared between nations for many
causes, some of them trivial. Some have been wars of
oppression, some of conquest, and so on, but the conflict of
1898 was in its way unique. It was a war waged in the
interests of humanity. For years upon years, one of our
next door neighbors, so to speak, the island of Cuba, lying
just off our southern coast, had felt the iron heel of the
despots of the Kingdom of Spain. As act after act of
oppression galled upon the natives of the island they were
stirred to revolt, only to be subdued and then subjected to
even more crushing indignities.</p>

<p>The last great revolt was perhaps the best organized of
any, and spreading from one end of the island to the
other, became of such magnitude as to almost reach the
dignity of a war between nations instead of the rebellion
of a colony against its dominating power.</p>

<p>With the same spirit that made heroes out of our forefathers
in the days of '76, the Cubans fought for their
rights and for independence, and their gallant struggles
not only enlisted the almost universal sympathy of this
country, but many soldiers of fortune from the United
States fought under the Cuban colors.</p>

<p>While the attitude of the government was diplomatically
neutral, the press and a large majority of citizens were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
out and out sympathizers with the Cuban cause, and it
was but a question of a short time before arms, ammunition,
supplies and men found themselves surreptitiously
on the way to Cuba, in aid of the cause of the islanders.</p>

<p>Naturally this state of affairs was resented by the
Spaniards, and the feelings of the two nations gradually
became more and more strained, even though diplomatically
there was no breach.</p>

<p>No doubt the sensational press, especially the so-called
"yellow journals", had a great deal to do with inflaming
the public passion, but carefully planned investigations
of the conditions on the island revealed a state of affairs
so gross that the worst stories of cruelty and inhumanity
seemed plausible, and the feeling against Spain eventually
became so bitter that it needed only the spark to kindle
the flame of war.</p>

<p>This was eventually furnished, and is one of the blackest
chapters of the Cuban war, by the destruction of an
American warship while lying peacefully at anchor in
Havana harbor, under the guns of the Spanish forts, and
in a time of peace.</p>

<p>The "Maine" had been ordered to Cuban waters to look
out for American interests. She was received in due form
by the Spanish authorities, and her berth was picked out
by them. While lying at anchor on the night of February
15, 1898, she was blown up from the outside, presumably
by a mine, and many lives lost, while many more men
were horribly injured.</p>

<p>This was undoubtedly the specific act that led to the
opening of war between the United States and Spain, the
details of which will be found in other volumes.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of this book to treat simply of the part
played in the conflict by the Eighth Regiment, Massachu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>setts
Infantry, U. S. V., which was the official designation
of the boys of the Eighth Regiment Infantry, Massachusetts
Volunteer Militia, when called into the service of the
United States.</p>

<p>Although one of the first volunteer regiments to get
away, it so happened that it was so assigned for duty that
it missed getting into an engagement with the enemy,
although being sent to Cuba and performing several
months of its service there. It was the first foreign service
of the regiment, and was a performance that will take
a prominent part in the history of the Eighth Massachusetts,
which embraces so long and honorable a record.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I have been requested by the author, Mr.
Harry E. Webber, to write some account of
the Eighth Massachusetts Regiment, while
under my command during the Spanish-American
war.</p>

<p>I reported for duty in Chickamauga Park, June 20th,
1898, and was assigned to the Second Brigade, First
Division of the First Corps, consisting of the Third Illinois,
Fourth Pennsylvania, and Fourth Ohio Regiments.
These were all good regiments, especially the Fourth
Pennsylvania, under Colonel David B. Case. As I expected
to remain with this brigade throughout the war,
I began an inspection by company, battalion, and regiment,
so that I might learn something more about their
actual condition, and the capacity of the officers than
could be learned on parade. I mention this circumstance,
not because it concerns the Eighth Massachusetts, but because
the information I gathered was of the greatest use
to me later on in dealing with other volunteer regiments.</p>

<p>I did not complete this inspection, however, as on the
28th of June, I was assigned to the command of the
Third Division of the First Corps, composed of the
Twelfth Minnesota, Fifth Pennsylvania, First South Carolina,
Eighth Massachusetts, Twelfth New York, Twenty-First
Kansas, Ninth Pennsylvania, Second Missouri, and
First New Hampshire. Subsequently, during the changes
and vicissitudes which occurred, there were assigned or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
attached to this Division, the Third United States Volunteers,
Engineers, the Fifth Missouri, the One Hundred
and Sixtieth Indiana, the Second, Third and Fourth Kentucky,
Third Mississippi, First Territorial, and the Third
and Fourth Immune Regiments of Infantry, and one
squadron of the First Kentucky Cavalry,&mdash;so that I had
ample opportunity to observe and compare different volunteer
regiments.</p>

<p>The Eighth Massachusetts arrived in the Park May
19th, and came under my observation about one month
later, and before I joined the Third Division. It was the
only volunteer regiment I saw fully uniformed <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'in kahki'">in khaki</ins>.
As this dress was new to me, it attracted my attention at
once, and I rode over twice to the Second Brigade of the
Third Division for a better look at the regiment, which,
needless to say, made a very favorable impression.</p>

<p>As will doubtless be remembered, the Third Division
remained in the Park until the 21st of August, when it
was transferred to Lexington, Kentucky, where it went
into camp on the Bryan road at Clark's Farm, about five
miles east of the city. There it remained until November
4th, its official designation was changed by orders from
the War Department, to the Second Division, First Army
Corps, and on the 10th it was ordered to Georgia, the
Headquarters Signal Company, Third United States Volunteers,
Engineers, and First Brigade to Columbus, the
Second Brigade to Americus, and the Third Brigade to
Albany. At this time the Second Brigade consisted of
the Eighth Massachusetts, Twelfth New York and Fourth
Kentucky, under Brigadier General Waites, U. S. V. The
Fourth Kentucky was ordered to be mustered out, leaving
the other two regiments to compose the Brigade, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
arrangement was not changed while the Division remained
in service.</p>

<p>On the 16th of November I was relieved from the command
of the Second Division and ordered to the Second
Brigade, relieving General Waites, and was thus brought
into closer contact with the Eighth Massachusetts. The
Brigade remained in Americus until November 26th
when, under orders from the War Department, the headquarters,
the Brigade Hospital and the Twelfth New
York Regiment, were ordered to Charleston, S. C. en
route to Matanzas, Cuba, where it arrived January 1st.</p>

<p>A few days later the Eighth Massachusetts rejoined, and
not long thereafter the One Hundred and Sixtieth Indiana,
Third Kentucky, Tenth United States Infantry, and
six troops of the Second United States Cavalry which
composed the garrison of the city and district of Matanzas,
and the Second Brigade of the Second Division of the
First Army Corps, practically ceased to exist. When the
Third Division became the Second Division, Major General
Ludlow was assigned to command it. He remained
in command until December 17th when I was ordered to
relieve him. I rejoined the Second Brigade in Americus
December 26th and went with it to Cuba.</p>

<p>The Eighth remained in Matanzas until April 4, 1899,
when it sailed for Boston, where it was mustered out of
the service of the United States, and reverted to its status
as a regiment of the National Guard. While it was not
given to the Eighth Massachusetts to undergo the supreme
test of the battlefield, it proved beyond the shadow of a
doubt by its calm indifference to death in other forms and
its devotion to duty, that it would have met that test with
a glorified record of good discipline and steadfast courage.
Who among all of those who had the misfortune to re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>main
in Chickamauga Park through the summer of 1898,
will ever forget the trials and dangers of that encampment?
From forty to sixty thousand men huddled together
within an area not too large for a sedentary camp
of two divisions.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Prior to August 1st the camps of all the regiments of
the Third Division, were in the woods with an average of
from six to eight men in a tent, many of which were unfit
for occupancy. Polluted water, insufficient supplies and
protection from the incessant rains of that year, and the
fact that neither the camp nor the tents were ever moved,
from lack of space, produced their inevitable result, and
when the Third Division left the Park, August 21st,
there were twenty-nine officers and 1237 enlisted men on
the sick report, out of 337 officers and 9464 men present;
or, in other words, one officer out of twelve and one man
out of eight. Although questioned at the time by those
high in authority, it is now well known that a large proportion
of the sick had typhoid fever; in fact it was epidemic.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>My recollections of Chickamauga Park are not pleasant
for reasons which I cannot very well explain here. It is
sufficient to say that I was fully cognizant of the wretched
conditions which sent the sick report higher each day and
subjected the sick in hospital to needless privation and
suffering, but was powerless to prevent or ameliorate them.
In fact, for administrative purposes, I was very little
more than a figure head, although held responsible by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>regiments, whose appeals for a relief which never came
while we remained in the Park, were most distressing to
me. At that time the collapse of the war had not been
foreseen, and although the Spanish forces in the eastern
district of Santiago, Cuba had capitulated July 16, it
was not until the protocol of August 12th, providing for
a cessation of hostilities, that we felt the war was over
and that the Third Division would probably never fire a
hostile shot. In the meantime, however, under the orders
of the Corps Commander, the Division was held in readiness
to move at a moment's notice, and every effort was
made to prepare it for service against the Spaniards.</p>

<p>To this end, and on the day after I assumed the command,
orders were issued to prepare the Division for active
service in accordance with the instructions of the War
Department. These prescribed the clothing, ammunition,
and rations to be carried on the person and in the two
wagons allowed each company,&mdash;all other clothing and
all other personal belongings of the men to be packed in
boxes legibly marked with the company and regiment, and
turned over to the depot quartermaster for storage or shipment.
To render the officers and men expert in packing,
and to determine just what could be carried under the instructions
referred to, each regiment was required to
strike tents and pack up, after which it was marched to
the regimental parade grounds, followed by its wagons,
and inspected by the Brigade Commander. It was well
understood that all regimental and company property
which had not been disposed of when marching orders
were received, must be abandoned.</p>

<p>As up to the time I assumed command of the Division
there had been no target practice, on July 1, Major
Edward H. Eldredge, of the Eighth Massachusetts, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
appointed Inspector of Rifle Practice, and preparations
were at once made to begin target practice. Nothing
could have been more fortunate than the selection of the
major for this most important branch of instruction. Conscientious,
enthusiastic, and thoroughly competent, he had
the target ranges established, and the Division at work
firing within a week, and this was continued daily (Sunday
excepted), until just before the Division left the
Park.</p>

<p>On July 26 a division rifle competition was held, each
regiment furnishing a team of 12 men; ten shots were
fired off hand by each man, at 160 yards (possible score
600 points). The highest score was made by the Eighth
Massachusetts with 481 points; the lowest score was 409.</p>

<p>In the course of the instruction it was found that many
men had never fired a gun and were correspondingly ignorant
of this most important requirement. What would
they have done in the line of battle? Well, I will tell
you. Those who were not killed would have been perfectly
demoralized until they either ran away or perhaps
were wounded, in which case they would have added
vastly to the cares of the Division Commander and his
medical staff. In either case, they would have been of
no possible use except as stretcher bearers. Nothing
could be more objectionable on the part of the high military
authorities than to send such men under fire, and
there is no possible excuse for it.</p>

<p>Other measures taken to prepare the Division for active
service were careful instruction in guard duty, the service
of advance guards and outposts, by battalions and regiments;
litter drill and "first aid."</p>

<p>As it was rumored that the First Corps would be sent
against Havana, orders were issued for the formation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a pioneer detachment in each regiment to consist of one
officer, two non-commissioned officers and ten privates,
to be specially selected for their practical knowledge of
the duties of pioneers, viz: the removal of obstructions,
corduroying roads, the building, repair and destruction of
simple bridges, culverts, railroad beds and embankments,
and the use of high explosives. No difficulty whatever
was experienced in finding the men who in the discharge
of their duties rendered most valuable services to the
Division.</p>

<p>To give the brigade and regimental commanders some
idea of the difficulty of forming the Division in line of
battle on broken and obstructed ground, and to exercise
the officers and men in preserving the line, supplying
ammunition, and caring for the wounded,&mdash;problems in
which the entire Division took part, were carried out
practically.</p>

<p>Many of you will doubtless remember those exercises
and how difficult it was to form the Division in line without
wide gaps between brigades, or to move it in any
direction without breaking the formation. These problems,
although extremely simple, were of great benefit as a relief
to the monotony of drill, and in testing the field efficiency
of the medical and ordinance services.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Corps Commander, with the First
Division of the Corps, left the Park en route to Cuba and
Porto Rico, and on August 15th I went to Lexington to
select a camp for the Third Division, in which the typhoid
had spread rapidly, and on August 21st, the movement to
Lexington began. Although we left between three and
four hundred men in the hospital when we moved to Lexington,
the Division was so thoroughly impregnated with
this disease and with malarial fever that more cases were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
inevitable, and the hospital of 1000 beds, which was established
in anticipation of this very contingency, proved
inadequate, and but for the timely removal of the
convalescents to other places, would have needed a large
extension. Those of the regiment now living will not have
forgotten the struggle which then took place to stamp out
the typhoid fever. It was a fight to a finish, in which
every available means known to medical and sanitary
science was used during a period of three months.</p>

<p>For the information of those members of the regiment
who have joined since the war with Spain, and because it
was the most serious condition which confronted the regiment
during its service in the field, I venture to give some
account of our efforts to overcome this dread disease.</p>

<p>In selecting and arranging the site of the Division encampment,
I was influenced more by sanitary requirements
than by any other considerations whatever. To the camp
of each regiment fifty acres of cleared land were allowed.
This insured wide company streets, sufficient space between
tents to admit of their being moved, plenty of room for
the regimental and battalion staffs, guard tents, cook tents,
sinks, corrals, and regimental parade grounds, with sufficient
isolation from neighboring regiments.</p>

<p>Ground was also set aside for division and brigade headquarters,
and for a general parade ground, the division
hospital and the various departments of supply, and these
were far enough removed from each other and the troops
to prevent any encroachment. All told, the Division
occupied about 1000 acres.</p>

<p>The different camps were then laid out by the division
engineer, aided by the pioneer corps, and a copious supply
of pure water secured, and all the sinks (kitchen and
men's), were dug, ditched and housed, and tent floors made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
ready before the first regiment of the Division arrived, so
that there was no occasion for defiling the ground or for
unnecessary exposure to the weather.</p>

<p>As soon as practicable after the regiments arrived, the
following sanitary orders were carried into effect. A non-commissioned
officer was placed in charge of every sink,
who received his instructions from the regimental surgeon
as to the use of chloride of lime, quick lime, crude petroleum
and corrosive sublimate, large quantities of which
were provided by the medical purveyor and chief quartermaster
of the Division.</p>

<p>For example, a box of the chloride of lime was kept in
each of the men's sinks and it was the duty of the non-commissioned
officer in charge to see that a small quantity
was thrown into the sink three times daily, and that the
sink floors were scrubbed every morning and then mopped
with a solution of corrosive sublimate. All the men's
sinks were lighted at night. Quick-lime and crude petroleum
were also used in all the sinks, not only as
disinfectants, but to keep the flies away.</p>

<p>Tents were moved once each week, the sites vacated
thoroughly sprinkled with quick-lime, the under surface
of the floors lime washed, and the tent floors mopped with
a solution of corrosive sublimate; tent walls were raised,
clothing and bedding thoroughly aired daily; all bed
sacks were filled with clean straw, the old straw burned,
and the bed sacks boiled every month, and whenever a
man was sent to the hospital his bed sack received the
same treatment; all water barrels were burned out every
two weeks, all stable manure removed from the camp
daily, and together with all other refuse, burned, and for
this purpose regimental or brigade crematories were constructed
as might be most convenient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Facilities were provided in each company for washing
and bathing and every soldier was required to bathe at
least twice each week and to keep his hair and beard neatly
trimmed. All drinking water was boiled and filtered
and the men cautioned against drinking water of any
other kind.</p>

<p>The indiscriminate sale and use of farm products, garden
truck, fruit, pies, cakes, and all soft drinks were prohibited,
nor were hucksters permitted in any of the regimental
camps without the written authority of the commanding
officer.</p>

<p>To insure the execution of these instructions, a division
sanitary inspector was appointed, whose duty it was to
visit the camp of each regiment daily and, together with
the medical officer on duty and officer of the day, make
inspection of the police of the camp, giving all needful
orders for the correction of sanitary abuses and defects.</p>

<p>As no regimental hospitals were contemplated by the
War Department, and none were permitted in Camp Hamilton,
men sick enough to require treatment in bed were
removed to the division hospital. On arriving there their
clothing was removed and carefully disinfected, labeled
and packed away, and if their cases were of doubtful character
they were sent to the detention ward until the nature
of their disease could be determined, when they were disposed
of accordingly.</p>

<p>At 2 P. M. daily a medical officer of each regiment reported
at the division hospital, and with the medical
officer in charge of the wards, visited the sick of his regiment
and decided whether they should be returned to duty
or not. This had a very good effect, as it brought the
medical officers of the regiment into daily contact with the
sick of their own regiments, which was a great comfort to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
them, and besides kept the medical officers fully informed
of their condition.</p>

<p>As far as possible the sick of the different regiments
were kept together, and no one except the regimental and
company commanders, the medical officers, chaplains, and
immediate relatives of the sick were allowed to visit them.
This restriction was rendered necessary by the danger of
infection in typhoid cases, and to prevent the excitement
and noise caused by visitors.</p>

<p>I am aware that many of the requirements and restrictions
ordered at that time were considered harsh and
unnecessary and gave rise to some bad feeling and grumbling,
but as they had the unqualified approval of the
medical staff, I had no hesitation in enforcing them. That
they were fully justified was clearly shown by the results.</p>

<p>Within a short time after our arrival in Lexington the
number of sick increased so rapidly that the division hospital
was filled to overflowing. But in the course of five
or six weeks, and as a consequence of our strenuous efforts,
the number began to diminish, until finally, and
before the Division moved to Georgia in November, not
a single case remained in the Division outside of the hospitals,
and no new cases were ever reported to me while
the Division remained in service.</p>

<p>Of the part taken by the Eighth Massachusetts in this
heroic struggle, a great deal might be written by way of
commendation. It is probably sufficient to say that
Colonel Pew and his officers appeared to realize fully the
gravity of the situation, and relying on the good discipline
and high order of intelligence of the rank and file,
had but little difficulty in carrying out the sanitary regulations
of the camp, thus preserving the lives of many of
the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Before leaving this subject, and at the risk of exhausting
your patience, I can not refrain from giving you a
word of warning. Of all the diseases which infest
sedentary camps, such as those established in the United
States and Cuba during the recent war, none is more insidious
or deadly in its effects than typhoid fever.</p>

<p>It would be very unusual indeed for a regiment of the
National Guard or of Volunteers to assemble in camp at
any time without bringing with it at least one case of undeveloped
typhoid fever. Now, a week may elapse before
such a case is discovered and reported, and in the meantime
the man who has it may have given it to a dozen
other men through fecal and urinary discharges, and
through carelessness in using the sink in washing his
hands and bathing, and in keeping his clothing absolutely
free from that kind of pollution. Hence the importance
of personal cleanliness and the strictest enforcement of all
the sanitary rules which may be established.</p>

<p>In a camp of regular soldiers thoroughly instructed in
the duties of sentinels, and not afraid to enforce their
orders, this is not difficult, but among volunteers where
guard duty is often not understood, or is looked upon with
disfavor, and but little sense of individual responsibility,
it is a very difficult matter, and such camps may speedily
and easily become hot beds for the spread of typhoid and
other diseases.</p>

<p>Bear this in mind and resolve that should the exigencies
of the military service ever require you to go into camp
again, you will not only keep yourselves clean, but will
insist on a clean camp, clean kitchens and sinks, clean
food and mess kits, and that you will mercilessly punish
all infractions of sanitary rules, as well as the sentinels
or other guards who knowingly permit them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>I remained in command of the Second Division until
November 16th, when I was relieved, and on the 21st
assumed command of the Second Brigade at Americus.
Although I knew the Eighth Massachusetts quite well, I
now determined to know it thoroughly, and on November
28th, commenced an inspection of the regiment by battalion,
and in order that every officer and enlisted man
might attend, it was ordered that no guard or other detail
would be furnished by the battalion under inspection.</p>

<p>I began with the First Battalion of the Eighth Massachusetts
and wound up with the Third Battalion, giving
each just such a critical inspection as was prescribed for
regulars. In other words, I made a careful examination
of the arms and equipments, clothing, camp and garrison
equipage, mess books, records and drills of each company,
battalion and regiment.</p>

<p>Target practice was resumed as soon as the Brigade
was settled in camp, and each regiment was given the
most careful and detailed instruction in outpost duties
and those of the advanced guard. An effort was also
made to instruct the Brigade in the principles of a front
and flank attack, beginning at short distances, which were
extended finally to 3000 yards over obstructed ground, the
enemy's position being indicated, and as far as possible the
exercises made as realistic as possible.</p>

<p>The month spent at Americus was full of professional
interest and profit, and caused me to realize more fully
the very great advantage of a brigade camp over larger
ones, and how much better it would have been at the outset
to have fully equipped each regiment in its State
camp, to then have assembled it with other regiments in a
brigade camp&mdash;preferably in the same State&mdash;commanded
by a thoroughly competent and active general officer, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to receive the preliminary instruction so easily given under
such circumstances, and so next to impossible in the
camp of a Division of an army corps.</p>

<p>The Eighth Massachusetts and Twelfth New York
were fairly well equipped when I joined them in the Park,
but the First South Carolina regiment was without arms,
equipment or uniforms. The men ate with their fingers
for several weeks, and relied on such crude dishes as could
be improvised from tomato-cans, etc. I have no doubt that
much of the complaint made by this regiment about the
rations, was chiefly due to this.</p>

<p>The Eighth Massachusetts in two detachments left
Americus January 6th and 8th, and arrived in Matanzas
January 10th and 13th and went into camp near Fort San
Severino on the west side of the bay.</p>

<p>On the 12th of January the last of the fifteen thousand
Spanish soldiers under Generals Merina and Molina,
composing the garrison of Matanzas, sailed away, and
about 8 o'clock in the evening, General Bettancourt and
his detachment of insurgent troops marched into the city,
which went <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'wild with excitment'">wild with excitement</ins>. The First Battalion
Eighth Massachusetts and Twelfth New York were held
in readiness that night lest there should be any hostile
demonstration towards the Spanish residents of the city.
It turned out that the natives were so intent on celebrating
the departure of the Spanish troops that no attention
was paid to anything else, and apart from that the night
passed quietly.</p>

<p>On January 12th Major-General J. H. Wilson relieved
me from command of the Department of Matanzas, and
on the following day I was assigned to command the District
of Matanzas with headquarters in the city. Up to
this time I had been interested chiefly in arranging for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the evacuation of the Spaniards, in caring for the troops,
and getting them settled in camp.</p>

<p>On January 5th a bureau of street cleaning and sanitation
had been established as the result of a careful inspection
of the city, and the prevalence of yellow fever
during the preceding month. Six deaths had occurred,
and we were all somewhat solicitous about the future.
Two cases occurred, one a civilian who died, the other a
soldier, who recovered.</p>

<p>As a precautionary measure the old yellow fever hospital
was burned and a new one of canvas erected near
the district hospital. I then gave my attention to the
very serious and delicate duties connected with the administration
of the District and City of Matanzas, in
accordance with the laws of war, and the orders of the
President.</p>

<p>Although by virtue of the military occupation of Cuba
martial law prevailed, it was the President's wish that as
far as possible the inhabitants might be secured in their
persons, and property, and in all their private rights and
relations as long as they performed their duties, and that
they be protected in their homes, their employments, and
in the free exercise of their religion. That as far as possible
the municipal laws such as related to the private rights
of persons and property, and provided for the punishment
of crime, should be continued in force, to be
administered by the ordinary tribunals substantially as
they were before the occupation.</p>

<p>The frame work of municipal government in Cuba was
excellent, far better in some respects than our own, but
Spaniards filled nearly all the insular, provincial and
municipal offices and municipal government was under
the direct supervision of the provincial and insular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
governments. Nevertheless, the municipal organization
was complete, excellent of its kind, and ample for
the government of the city and district, and I determined
at the outset to instil into the local authorities a proper
sense of their responsibilities and authority as the agent
of a free and liberal government, and to require them to
perform all their duties, using the troops only when
necessary to aid their efforts to maintain law and order
and to prevent any disorderly conduct on the part of the
officers or men. To this end a provost marshal with a
suitable guard was appointed and Fort San Severino was
converted into a military prison.</p>

<p>The scope of this article will not admit of a detailed
account of all that was done for the people and City of
Matanzas during our stay there. It is probably sufficient
to say that we cleaned and disinfected the city and established
a system of sanitation so thorough that a recent
traveler through the island told me that Matanzas was the
cleanest and healthiest city in Cuba, and that there had
been no case of yellow fever there since we left. To accomplish
this a certain number of our officers and non-commissioned
officers and men associated with the various
city officials, who were, however, required to take the lead,
the officers acting as advisers and assistants when necessary.</p>

<p>Matanzas was suffering at that time from the effects of
the reconcentration ordered by General Weyler, and the
population has been increased from about 25,000 to
40,000, chiefly refugees. As soon as it could be done these
people were returned to their old homes, or provided with
homes elsewhere. In the meantime, they, together with
all other indigent poor, to the number of 19,373, were fed
by the United States Government. Prior to this many&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>chiefly
children&mdash;died of starvation, and many more would
have followed but for the timely arrival of the troops.</p>

<p>Some idea of what was done by the Army for the people
of Matanzas may be gathered from the vital statistics of
the city. During the year 1897 there were 6,729 recorded
deaths, and in 1898, 5,972, or an average of 6,350 or
over 500 deaths per month. In April, 1899, the last report
rendered before we left showed a total of 68 deaths,
quite a perceptible decrease in four months. I have enlarged
somewhat on this subject because the results of our
efforts were so gratifying, and because the Eighth Massachusetts
took an important part in this work, especially
Chaplain George D. Sanders.</p>

<p>Another most useful and special service rendered by
the Eighth was a settlement of the first strike ever inaugurated
in Matanzas. Labor unions and strikes were
unknown before American occupation, but it was not long
before labor <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'union delagates'">union delegates</ins> from the States arrived in
Havana, and soon unions were formed and rumors of
strikes reached Matanzas, to be followed later by two delegates
who organized a union and started a strike for
shorter hours and higher pay among the employees of the
railway and the stevedores engaged in loading the annual
sugar crop, then arriving in vast quantities. As a large
number of the native workmen did not care to strike,
those who did immediately began the kind of intimidation
usually resorted to in this country, and several were assaulted
and more threatened, and the situation became
serious.</p>

<p>At this point the manager of the road appealed to me
for protection and I sent two companies of the Eighth to
the freight yards to see that protection was given. I gave
no instructions but relied on the experience and good sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the officers and men, and they ended the strike to my
entire satisfaction. No doubt they can recall the circumstances,
and the very effective measures resorted to.</p>

<p>That they were good and sufficient may be inferred
from the fact that no one ever complained of them, except
the two delegates, and they were told they could go to
jail or leave town, which latter they did by the first available
train, and peace and contentment prevailed thereafter
to the end.</p>

<p>On the 20th of January commenced the festivities to
celebrate the evacuation of Cuba by the Spaniards, and
on February 22nd another fiesta was held in honor of
General Maximo Gomez, at that time the idol of the
Cubans. Upon both occasions the entire population
thronged the streets and the greatest excitement prevailed.
General Gomez remained in Matanzas three days, and
with his departure the city settled down into its usual
calm.</p>

<p>Thanks to the tact and excellent conduct of the troops,
nothing occurred to disturb the festivities; the crowds
were handled with great skill and with due regard to their
susceptibilities and their first taste of personal liberty&mdash;not
only as individuals but as a community. And to the
very great honor of the troops it may be said that this was
ever the rule in dealing with the residents of the city, no
complaint of misconduct, public or private, having ever
been made to me.</p>

<p>The Eighth Massachusetts was especially fortunate in
gaining the good will of the Cubans, and when it left
Matanzas was the recipient of a letter of enthusiastic
commendation from the mayor of the city. A copy of
the letter was sent to me, and the very complimentary
expressions of the mayor were neither exaggerated nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
unmerited. The regiment deserved a great deal from
the people of Matanzas, and it was very gratifying to me
to know that they appreciated your services.</p>

<p>I regret that in this brief sketch I have not been able
to go more into detail concerning the duties, the trials
and successful achievements of the Eighth Massachusetts
during the Spanish War. It is sufficient for me to say
as your brigade and division commander, that while we
were together, a day rarely passed that I did not ride
through your camp, turn out the guard and take a general
look around, and on every Sunday make a careful inspection,
and it gives me the greatest pleasure to say that
in point of efficiency the regiment had few equals, and no
superiors, among the volunteer regiments which came
under my observation.</p>

<p>Proper <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'esprit du corps'">esprit de corps</ins></span> and a high sense of duty pervaded
the regiment, due in great measure to the excellent
example of Colonel Pew and his field officers, Lieutenant-Colonels
Bailey and Stopford and Majors Eldredge and
Graves. During the summer of 1907 I visited the regiment
in camp at South Framingham and was glad to note
that the instruction and the experience of the war had not
been forgotten.</p>

<p>In conclusion I beg to remind you that while all military
efforts should be directed towards the preparation
of soldiers for the great tests of the battlefield, because so
much may depend on the result, there are other tests
which if successfully borne, entitle soldiers to as much
credit as good conduct under fire, although they may not
bring them as much renown.</p>

<p>Among disciplined soldiers it is the exception to find
one who does not behave well under fire, but it by no
means follows that the bravest will not falter in their duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
if beset in a sedentary camp with plague, pestilence or
famine. It is not as much of a strain on the nerves to see
a soldier killed in battle as to see him die of an epidemic
disease, nor do I believe it is as hard for the soldier. When
a soldier goes under fire, he is facing the very contingency
for which he enlisted and for which he has been trained.
He knows he may be shot and wounded or killed, but his
duty <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'lies unequivocably'">lies unequivocally</ins> before him and appeals directly
to his pride and to his manhood in a way disease can
never do. Who will say then that the men who fought
the battle of San Juan deserved more credit than those
who died from typhoid fever while acting as volunteer
nurses to their comrades or in the discharge of other
duties, when by getting a furlough or running away they
could have avoided all risk. The excitement of battle and
the example of brave men have made a hero of many a
man who but for that would have run away.</p>

<p>But in a typhoid fever camp death lurks everywhere
and there is no stimulating excitement to strengthen
those who have to face it.</p>

<p>Therefore the highest honors should not be given solely
to those soldiers who are so fortunate as to do their duty
under fire, but to those as well who do their duty where-ever
they may be, regardless of consequences, and in all
the circumstances which may attend them.</p>

<p>Do not therefore complain, as I have heard some of you
do, or tinge your recollections of the war with regret, because
you did not take part in the only battle that was
fought, but, hoping for better luck next time, find supreme
satisfaction in the reflection that you did your whole duty
in places where death was quite as imminent as on San
Juan Hill, and that no other regiment, regular or volunteer,
could have done more.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Between February 15th, when the U. S. S.
Maine was destroyed in the harbor of Havana,
and March 28th, 1898, when Congress received
the report of the Naval Board of
Inquiry, declaring the Maine to have been destroyed by
an exterior explosion, public opinion in the United States
was crystalizing in favor of declaring war with Spain
and recognizing the independence of Cuba.</p>

<p>On March 16th a meeting of the officers of the Eighth
Regiment Infantry, M. V. M., was held in the Headquarters
of the regiment at Salem. The officers, with one
exception, authorized the Colonel to tender their services
as part of any quota Massachusetts might be called upon
to furnish. Company commanders were directed to interview
each member of their companies and report to the
Adjutant the number of men ready to volunteer. The
reports of the various company commanders, show that by
April 1st, all but eleven men had authorized the Colonel
to tender their services. It is said that the Eighth was
the first National Guard Regiment in the country ready,
after a careful canvass of its officers and men, to volunteer.</p>

<p>On March 29th resolutions declaring war with Spain
were introduced into both houses of Congress. Congress
had appropriated $50,000,000 for national defence, and
the Legislature of Massachusetts followed with an appropriation
of $500,000 to equip troops.</p>

<p>War was coming and troops were to be needed. This
much was certain, but no one could tell how the necessary
troops would be raised. It was rumored that the military
advisors of the government were divided in their councils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and that some favored the retention of the Militia for
local defence, and the organization of new regiments of
volunteers to fill the expected call. For weeks the Adjutant
was ready to tender the services of the Eighth as a
militia, or volunteer regiment, whichever way the call
came. The tension was so great that on April 22nd the
following letter was sent to the Governor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letter">

<p>I have the honor to represent to the Commander-in-Chief
that the officers and men of the Eighth Regiment
are willing and anxious to respond to any call for volunteers,
and I hereby tender the services of the Regiment,
if agreeable to the wishes of the Commander-in-Chief, to

<p class="noindent">My dear Sir:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have this moment had placed in my hands your letter
of April 22nd addressed to Maj. Gen. Samuel Dalton, expressing
to the Commander-in-Chief the willingness and
desire of the officers and men of the Eighth Regiment to
respond to any call for volunteers and tendering the services
of the Regiment, if agreeable to the wishes of the
Commander-in-Chief, to form a part of any quota that
Massachusetts may be called upon to furnish.</p>

<p>I appreciate highly the zeal and patriotism of your offer,
which will be placed upon file for future reference.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr4">Very truly yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Roger Wolcott</span>."</p></div>

<p>On April 23rd the President called for one hundred
twenty-five thousand volunteers, and on April 25th war
was declared with Spain. During the evening of the 25th,
Governor Wolcott was notified by a telegram from the
Secretary of War, that the Massachusetts quota, under the
call of the President, would be four regiments of infantry,
and three batteries of heavy artillery. Nothing was
yet decided how these regiments should be raised.</p>

<p>The infantry organizations in Massachusetts Militia
were at this time five line regiments and two corps of
cadets. This information as to the Massachusetts quota<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
increased the suspense, as it was apparent, that even if
militia regiments were accepted, all could not go. About
this time the newspapers published statements from the
Governor, which were construed to mean, the state militia
would be used for local defence, as there was much talk
of a descent upon the Massachusetts coast by Cevera's
fleet, which was then rendezvouing at the Cape Verde
Islands.</p>

<p>The suspense of the militia was not relieved until late
in the afternoon of April 27th, when the Governor received
a letter from the Secretary of War, requesting him
to furnish four regiments of infantry to serve for the
period of two years unless sooner discharged. In his letter
the Secretary of War expressed a desire that as far as
practicable, the National Guard be given preference.</p>

<p>To meet this summons to arms, the Governor, by an
order issued April 28th, designated as the four infantry
regiments to be offered the privilege of volunteering under
this call, the Second, Sixth, Eighth and Ninth. The commanding
officers of these regiments were required to cause
an individual canvass to be made of their subordinate officers
and enlisted men, to ascertain and make careful
record of those desiring to volunteer. These were to be
held subject to future orders and at the earliest possible
day, mustered into the service of the United States.</p>

<p>On the same evening that this communication was received
from the Secretary of War, the Governor notified
the Colonel of the Eighth Regiment to report to him in
person the next morning at the State House, Boston.
Colonel William A. Pew, Jr. immediately notified all the
officers of the regiment to meet him at the State House
the following afternoon at 2 o'clock. The commanding
officers of the four regiments designated, to be given the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
privilege of volunteering, met the Governor at the State
House in the forenoon of April 28th, and received their
official orders. They were directed to recruit their companies
to seventy-four men, and were informed that the
field, staff, and company officers would be appointed by the
Governor, upon the recommendation of the commanding
officer of each regiment.</p>

<p>At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, Colonel Pew met the officers
of the Eighth at the State House, and arranged the
details for the organization of the regiment. The various
company commanders had already received orders from
Regimental Headquarters to secure a list of recruits, so
that if called into the active service, they would have their
companies at war strength. The militia companies at this
time were allowed sixty men in the State service.</p>

<p>From the State House, company commanders immediately
proceeded to their home stations, and began recruiting
to seventy-four men.</p>

<p>Although the night of April 28th was stormy, and rain
fell in torrents, excitement was high, and the company
armories of the Eighth were filled with militiamen, and
recruiting was brisk. There was no difficulty in securing
the additional men.</p>

<p>In about all the cities and towns immediately following
the call for troops, Volunteer Aid Societies or Relief Committees
were formed at mass meetings, and various sums
of money were raised to equip the volunteers or to look
after their families.</p>

<p>On April 29th, the Eighth Regiment was ordered to
report at the State Camp Grounds at South Framingham,
on Thursday, May 5th, at 11 o'clock, A. M. The camp
was placed under the command of Col. E. P. Clark, the
senior officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>From April 28th to May 5th, was a continuous round
of excitement and bustle in the armories.</p>

<p>The companies were ordered to assemble on Lowell
Street near the Union Station in Boston not later than
10.30, May 5th. The scenes about the armories of the
various companies on May 5th was most pathetic, as the
wives, mothers, or sweethearts of the men gathered for the
farewell. In every instance the companies were escorted
to the station by local or military bodies, and the demonstrations
which took place as the companies marched
through the crowded streets had not been duplicated since
the call of President Lincoln was answered in 1861.</p>

<p>At Newburyport, the public and parochial schools were
given a half holiday, and the streets were decorated with
flags and bunting. Company A was escorted to the railroad
station by the Mayor and members of the City Government,
the Grand Army Post, and members of the Fire
Department. The streets were filled with thousands of
people, who displayed their enthusiasm by cheers and the
waving of flags and handkerchiefs. A field piece was
fired at brief intervals and the church bells and steam
whistles joined in the chorus of God speeds.</p>

<p>At Amesbury, the streets through which Company B
passed, were packed with humanity. Whistles of the factories
were blown, bells were rung, and there was a general
outburst of enthusiasm. The company was escorted to the
train by the Grand Army Veterans and members of the
High School Battalion.</p>

<p>At Marblehead, cheering crowds greeted the members
of Company C, under the escort of the Grand Army Post
and a delegation of citizens. Previous to starting from the
Armory, the Selectmen spoke words of farewell to the
soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>In Lynn, patriotism was at fever heat. The factories
and schools closed, and thousands lined the streets. Flags
were flying from all staffs, and many were carried by the
people along the line of march. Companies D and I were
escorted to the station by General Lander Post, G. A. R.,
and the English and Classical High School Battalions.
The Mayor and members of the City Government reviewed
the parade. At Central Square, near the station, twenty
thousand people gathered, and as the train bearing the
Lynn volunteers steamed out of the station, there arose a
mighty cheer for the soldier boys.</p>

<p>In Beverly, business was suspended, and the citizens
turned out en masse to bid good bye to Company E. The
company was escorted by the Grand Army Post, Fire
Department, school children, and a cavalcade of citizens.</p>

<p>At Haverhill, Company F and the Regimental Drum
Corps were given a most enthusiastic send off. The company
was escorted by the Grand Army Post and Sons of
Veterans. Mayor Chase delivered a farewell address at
the City Hall, after which the line of march was taken to
the station, where a crowd, numbering fifteen thousand,
witnessed their departure.</p>

<p>At Gloucester, Company G marched through lanes of
cheering citizens, the escort consisting of the Grand Army
Post, the Fourth of July Committee, the High School
Battalion, and the Sons of Veterans. The procession was
led by the Mayor. Hon. W. W. French presented the
Company with a silk flag on behalf of citizens, and the gift
was accepted by Captain Edward J. Horton for the company.</p>

<p>Salem witnessed scenes of enthusiasm as Company H
marched away. The streets were packed, and thousands
of small flags were waved by the cheering citizens as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
company marched to the station, escorted by the Second
Corps of Cadets, Grand Army Post, Naval Veterans, Letter
Carriers and Clerks, the Salem Light Infantry Veteran
Association, the Veteran Firemen Association, and a
barouche containing among others, Francis D. Cahill,
Salem's survivor of the Maine explosion. The Mayor and
the City Government reviewed the parade at City Hall,
and a large crowd packed the streets near the station to
witness the train, containing the members of the company,
pull out for Boston.</p>

<p>In Danvers, the people were early astir to give Company
K a rousing farewell. It was escorted through the principal
streets by a cavalcade, the Grand Army Post, High
School Cadets, and a body of citizens.</p>

<p>Lawrence turned out in force to speed the departure of
Company L. At the Armory, Rev. Dr. H. E. Barnes offered
prayer, after which the men marched to the station
escorted by the Grand Army Post and Battery C. As the
train bore the company out of the station, Battery C fired
a salute, and the whistles of the locomotives in the engine
yard mingled with the cheers that arose from thousands of
throats.</p>

<p>At Somerville, on the evening before departure, Company
M was entertained by the citizens at Union Hall.
The next morning they were escorted to the station by a
large company of citizens, the Grand Army Posts, and
members of the Relief Corps.</p>

<p>The reception of the regiment in Boston was equally
enthusiastic. The Evening Transcript described the scenes
along the line of march as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"From 9 o'clock this morning until the order to march
was given, the Union Station was filled with cheering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
thousands and marching companies. They came by different
trains, according to the places from which they
started. As the companies left the train, they formed in
the train shed, and marched to Lowell Street, where the
parade was formed, with the right of line resting on Causeway
Street. At 10.50 o'clock the regiment had formed on
Lowell Street. An orderly announced that all of the companies
had arrived at their positions in the line. Colonel
Pew gave the command, and the clear, shrill notes of the
bugle echoed along the line. Just then the sun, which
had been hidden behind gray and threatening clouds,
broke out, and the men welcomed this as a good omen in
their coming service. The regiment swung off to the tune
of the 'Stars and Stripes Forever' by the Eighth Regiment
Band. Half way down the line was the Fife and Drum
Corps playing 'The Girl I Left Behind Me.' Lowell Street,
Merrimac Streets, and in fact all of the streets about the
Union Station were crowded by thousands, and the various
companies were given a most enthusiastic reception all
along the line of march, which was over the following
streets:&mdash;Merrimac to Haymarket Square, Washington
and School, Beacon, Arlington and Boylston Streets to
Huntington Avenue, a special train being taken at the
Huntington Avenue station of the Boston &amp; Albany R. R.</p>

<p>Far down Beacon Street could be seen the crowding
thousands from a point of vantage on the State House
steps; people were standing on tiptoe and craning their
necks for a glimpse of the approaching troops. Presently
the strains of martial music floated from below, mingled
with the subdued and far away cheers which heralded the
approach of the soldiers. The cheerings grew nearer and
louder. One could catch now and again the air of the
stirring march, and now the platoon of mounted police
swung around the turn. On a chestnut horse at the head
of the regiment, came Colonel William A. Pew, Jr. of
Salem.</p>

<p>The head of the line passed Park Street and approached
the State House steps. The cheering grew continuous, and
there was a great waving of flags and handkerchiefs. Gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>eral
Curtis Guild, Jr. stepped to the side of the railing
and swung his hat, calling for three cheers for Colonel
Pew. They were given with a will, the thousands packed
outside of the police lines taking up the cry. Colonel Pew
and his staff saluted, and the review was in progress.</p>

<p>To none of the troops which have passed in review before
Governor Wolcott and his staff at the State House,
has there been given such a demonstration as that accorded
to the Eighth Regiment this morning. It was
shortly after 11 o'clock when the head of the line reached
the corner of Park and Beacon streets, and from the
moment that the first company had passed in review until
the last of the batch of raw recruits which brought up the
rear had gone from view, there was one continuous round
of applause and cheering. General Curtis Guild, Jr. led
in the cheering at the State House, and every time that
he waved his hat there was an answering thunder of
cheers. There were cheers for Colonel Pew, for the
Eighth Regiment, and Essex County. Old Glory was
cheered to the echo, and the gathered multitude was not
too hoarse to give three and a tiger for the raw recruits
who brought up the rear. Governor Wolcott and his
staff reviewed the parade as usual, from the lower steps at
the entrance to the State House. Above the upper steps
were packed with gaily dressed women and enthusiastic
men. The balconies were crowded, and the streets in all
directions, as far as the eye could see, were jammed with
crowding thousands. No more soldierly looking body of
men had passed the State Capitol for years than the
Eighth Regiment, which passed in review on its way to
the front this morning.</p>

<p>The Commanding Officer and Staff were mounted, this
being the first regiment parading with these officers
mounted. The men were in heavy marching order, with
rations for twenty-four hours in their haversacks. Officers
and men of the whole regiment wore their campaign hats,
and this gave them a businesslike appearance that seemed
to say,&mdash;'We are going to the front to work.'"</p></div>

<p class="drop-cap">Shortly after 2 o'clock on the afternoon of
May 5th, the Eighth marched onto the State
Camp Grounds at South Framingham. The
Second and Ninth Regiments turned out with
a hearty welcome as the Fife and Drum Corps swung
through the gate playing "Teddy Was a Sojer."</p>

<p>When the four volunteer regiments were mustered into
the service, they dispensed with bands. The Eighth, however,
took its drum corps, which as early as March 16th
had volunteered, through the Drum Major. Drum Major
Thomas was and still is (1908) an institution in the regiment.
No one remembers when he was not Drum Major.
Rumor says he was drummer boy at Bunker Hill, Lundy
Lane and Chepultepec, and all know he marched with
Sherman to the sea. Invincible against fever and malaria,
he is never sick. Always busy, never complaining or tired,
he is a cheerful regimental inspiration. Time does not
change him, except as it adds new glories in the form of
service stripes. His reveille from Low Scotch, through
Austrian, Hessian, Double Drag, Dutch, to Quick Scotch,
is always welcome as an eye opener. It is a tradition that
the Colonel gets up before reveille for the mere pleasure of
seeing Thomas lead, and of watching the drum sticks rattle.
It is certainly true that the regiment was never late
when Thomas led the band.</p>

<p>Camp was soon established. The Second Regiment,
which assembled May 3rd, occupied the right of the line;
next came the Ninth, which came into camp May 4th, followed
by the Eighth. On the left was reserved a position
for the Sixth, which was to assemble the next day. Ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>jutant
Edward H. Eldredge was detailed as Brigade
Adjutant General, and his place on the Regimental Staff
was filled by Lieutenant Thomas D. Barroll of L Company.</p>

<p>Dame Rumor was soon busy spreading reports that the
United States, personified by impartial and inexorable
army surgeons, was rejecting men as unfit for foreign service.
Already ten officers of the Second had been rejected
for physical deficiencies. What pledges, words and wills
had been unable to accomplish, the dread of a full service
medical examination accomplished, and officers and men,
who for years had smoked or broken minor rules of health,
stopped on the moment to brace themselves for this ordeal.</p>

<p>The officers were ordered before the doctors the day
after arriving in camp, and at intervals of twenty minutes
they reported in groups of threes. Major Dudley B. Purbeck,
who had recently suffered from a serious illness, was
rejected. There was much excitement in the streets of
Company C when it was reported that Captain James
Tucker, Lieutenants Edgar J. Marshall and Frank B.
Denning had failed to pass. The Selectmen and influential
citizens of Marblehead were appealed to, and in some way
secured a re-examination and a reversal of the finding in
the case of Lieutenant Denning, who was finally mustered
and commissioned as Captain.</p>

<p>After the officers had passed, the enlisted men faced
the surgeons, the companies going up in alphabetical
order. Many men were rejected and sent home. It was
the rule not to muster a company until it had a full complement
of qualified officers and men. The process was
slow, and it was not until May 10th that the first company
of the Eighth was mustered, followed in rapid succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
by the others. The last company was mustered May 11th,
and the Colonel sworn in.</p>

<p>The ceremony of mustering was interesting and impressive.
Companies were marched to Brigade Headquarters,
with the men arranged alphabetically in line.
Facing the colors, taking off their hats, and raising their
right hands, after roll call, they subscribed the following
oath administered by Captain Erastus M. Weaver, U. S.
A.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"All and each of you do solemnly swear that you will
bear true <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'faith and allegience'">faith and allegiance</ins> to the United States of
America, and that you will serve them honestly and faithfully
against all their enemies whomsoever, and that you
will obey the President of the United States, and the
orders of the officers appointed over you, according to the
rules and articles of war, so help you God."</p></div>

<p>There was much pleasant rivalry between the Eighth
and Ninth Regiments in a race to be first mustered in the
United States service. The last company of the Ninth
was mustered in just before the last company of the
Eighth, and the Colonel of the Eighth being the last officer
in the Regiment to be mustered into the service, was
mustered in before the Colonel of the Ninth. The important
question was never settled, which regiment was
first mustered into the United States service.</p>

<p>After a company was mustered into the service, its Captain
was given a copy of the Articles of War, and directed
to read them to his company. From this tiresome reading
of all the articles at once, a company wag said it was
the general impression that the whole regiment was
ordered by the President to suffer death or such other penalty
as the court martial should prescribe.</p>

<p>The designation of the Regiments as finally mustered
into the United States service, early became a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
interest. It was rumored that in as much as Massachusetts
sent sixty-two regiments to the Civil War, the numbering
of the regiments in the Spanish War was to begin
where the numbering of the Civil War regiments left off.
In that case the Eighth would be known as the Sixty-Third
or Sixty-Fourth Regiment. This enumeration was
followed in some states. The designation of the regiment
was left to Governor Wolcott, who published as the official
name, Eighth Regiment Massachusetts Infantry, U. S. V.</p>

<p>The facings on the uniform was immediately changed
from blue to white, and a collar device adopted consisting
of crossed rifles with the figure eight above, and the abbreviation
"Mass." below the rifles.</p>

<p>During the stay at Framingham everyone was busy,
recruits were drilled, the regiment was exercised in striking
and pitching tents, company cooks and kitchen police
were made familiar with the army ration, battalions and
companies were drilled, guards were instructed, and the
usual parade and daily ceremonies held. The days were
crisp and clear; the evenings, however, were chilly, but the
dampness was dissipated by roaring camp fires on the
parade, about which the soldiers clustered until taps.</p>

<p>It was the intention of the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts
to have the regiments leave the State in order
of the seniority of the Colonels. This would give third
place to the Eighth.</p>

<p>On May 13th, the Adjutant-General of the United States
Army telegraphed the United States mustering officer
at South Framingham to notify the Colonels of mustered
regiments to report direct to the War Department
when their regiments would be ready to leave the State.
This notice was sent to the Headquarters of the Eighth
and Ninth. Colonel Pew immediately telegraphed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
War Department that the Eighth was ready to leave at
once, and in a few hours received a telegraphic order to
take the regiment to Chickamauga Park, Georgia. Owing
to the lack of railroad transportation, it was impossible for
the Regiment to get away until May 16th.</p>

<p>Saturday, May 14th, was Eighth Regiment day at
Camp Dewey. On Friday evening as soon as the soldiers
were notified that the regiment was to hold itself ready to
move at once, they rushed to the telegraph station and
sent word to their friends at home that if they wished to
see them, they should come to Camp Dewey in the morning,
as it was expected that the Regiment would be on its
way south by Saturday night.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, the friends of the soldiers began
to arrive on the field, and every train brought crowds until
by noon there were hundreds from every town and city
having a company in the regiment. As the families of
the soldiers came into camp, they brought with them
boxes and bundles of the good things which a New England
housewife knows so well how to cook, and during
the hours between drills, there were family picnics all
about the camp.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Governor Wolcott and some of his
staff visited the camp to present the officers with their
commissions in the United States service. After passing
in review before His Excellency, the Regiment formed
three sides of a hollow square, with officers in the center.
The Governor and his party formed a fourth side. The
square was surrounded by friends of the Regiment, who
covered half of the great parade ground. The remarks
of His Excellency were deeply impressive, and at times
he visibly showed the emotion which he felt. In a voice
audible to everyone on the field, Governor Wolcott said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"Men of Essex and Middlesex:&mdash;Two days ago your
parting cheers made sweet music in the ears of your comrades
of the Second Regiment as they left the Commonwealth
in the high service of the United States of America.
Today you obey the same summons, and are ready,
as they were, to endure hardship and suffering in the same
exalted cause.</p>

<p>Your cause, men of Massachusetts, is a just and righteous
one. I greatly misread the heart of this great nation
if the historian of the future shall not record that this
war was entered upon by a mighty and free people, who
had heard, as long as they could endure them, the sighs
and groans of an oppressed neighboring population, bending
beneath the tyranny of a nation of the old world.</p>

<p>It is to set free the oppressed and to bind up their
wounds that you now enter the service of the United
States. You will find yourselves shoulder to shoulder
with the men of other states. Let there be no other rivalry
than generous emulation, that you shall show that the
men of Massachusetts, where valor calls for sacrifice, or
where the duty of the soldier calls for prompt obedience
and good discipline, are second to the sons of no other
Commonwealth and no other State in the United States
of America.</p>

<p>You leave with the prayers and the confidence of the
people of this Commonwealth. Officially, as the Governor
of the Commonwealth, I bid you Godspeed! And may the
God of battles bring you victory and an honorable peace!</p>

<p>It is now my privilege and honor to present to the
officers of the Eighth Massachusetts Infantry, United
States Volunteers, the commissions under which they enter
the service of the United States."</p></div>

<p>After presenting the commissions, Governor Wolcott
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"Colonel Pew:&mdash;You have a regiment worthy of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts and of the service of the
United States of America."</p></div>

<p>From May 14th to May 16th the Regiment waited, uncertain
when its train transportation would arrive. Shortly
after noon on the 16th, camp was struck. It was a
damp and dreary day. There was no large crowd to
cheer their departure, as the home stations of the companies
were too remote, and the movement too sudden for
the friends of the regiment to see them off. Late in the
afternoon the regiment passed in review before Governor
Wolcott, and took up its line of march for the railroad
station. There it was quickly embarked in three sections.
Each battalion had a section consisting of eleven cars,
one for baggage, one for guard quarters, and two for each
company. A Wagner sleeper was furnished on each
section for the accommodation of the officers. The first
section pulled out of the station at South Framingham at
6 o'clock, followed shortly afterwards by the others. The
last section left at 6.30. The three sections carried 47
officers and 896 men.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The route of the regiment to Chickamauga was
through the valleys of the Hudson and Shennandoah.
The cities of New York, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Washington and Knoxville,
were seen in passing, but stops were only made to allow
the officers to obtain meals for themselves and coffee for
the men. The Government furnished travel rations for
the men consisting of hard tack, canned corned beef, beans
and tomatoes, and a money allowance for coffee. In their
year of service, no one in the regiment ever discovered a
use for canned tomatoes as a travel ration.</p>

<p>During the trip hard tack circulated as souvenirs among
the girls at the various stops, usually inscribed with the
donor's name and address, and given in exchange for
pieces of ribbon and other feminine favors. Enthusiastic
crowds were in evidence at all the stations, where they
gathered to see the troop trains pass. The men were confined
to the cars, but managed to carry on many flirtations
and make exchanges through the windows. Every day they
were taken out at some stop for a run around or a bit of
setting up exercise, and once the Third Battalion took advantage
of a mountain stream for bathing purposes.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 19th the regiment awoke to
find itself in the Citico Freight Yard, just outside the city
of Chattanooga, together with other troop trains containing
the men of the Twelfth New York, and the Twenty-First
Kansas, with whom the regiment subsequently brigaded.
After spending a day in the freight yard, the sections
began late in the afternoon to slowly travel the fourteen
miles between Chattanooga and Chickamauga Park.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
At Battle Station the battalions disembarked, the baggage
was piled near the track and left under guard, while the
regiment enjoyed its first bivouac on a neighboring hill.</p>

<p>The Colonel reported to General Brooke and was told
that a camp site would be assigned and transportation for
the baggage furnished the following day.</p>

<p>Chickamauga Park is a National Reservation in the
northwestern corner of the State of Georgia, embracing
some ten squares miles of territory, and commemorates the
battle which was fought there in 1863. The park is
wooded, with here and there open fields. Much of the
underbrush had been cleared away, and good dirt roads
constructed by the Government. The water supply consisted
of a few dozen wells, which had supported a small
farming population before the Government purchased the
land. The soil is clayey above a limestone formation,
which frequently outcrops and renders digging difficult.
The months of May and June are liable to be pleasant and
dry, but in July and August, abundant rain turns the
ground where vegetation is worn off, into a mire of sticky
mud. On one side, the Park is bounded by Chickamauga
Creek, meaning in the Indian tongue, "The River of
Death", and into this creek the whole surface of the Park
drains. The Government intended to organize on this
ground the First, Third and Sixth Army Corps, and at
one time assembled about 55,000 men for this purpose.
The camp was named, Camp George H. Thomas, in honor
of the gallant soldier who rendered conspicuous service to
the Federal cause in the battle of Chickamauga.</p>

<p>The Eighth Regiment was assigned to the Second Brigade,
Third Division, First Army Corps. As Colonel
William A. Pew, Jr. was the senior Colonel in the three
regiments comprising this brigade, he was assigned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
command, pending the arrival of a Brigadier General,
and the command of the Eighth Regiment devolved upon
Lieutenant Colonel Edwin W. M. Bailey. Colonel Pew
remained in command of the Brigade until June 29th,
when he was succeeded by General Waites of Texas.
Lieutenant Thomas D. Barroll, the Regimental Adjutant,
and Lieutenant Charles F. Wonson, the Regimental
Quartermaster, were detailed to Brigade Headquarters,
and acted respectively as Adjutant General and Brigade
Quartermaster. Their places in the regiment were filled
by the detail of Lieutenant George W. Langdon, Acting
Regimental Adjutant, and Lieutenant George I. Canfield,
Acting Regimental Quartermaster, while Lieutenant Augustus
G. Reynolds acted as Regimental Commissary.</p>

<p>The Third Division of the First Army Corps encamped
on the Alexander Bridge road, near the southeastern
corner of the Park, and about three miles from the railroad
station. The camp of the Eighth was located in the
woods, which were not dense, but more than sufficient for
shade purposes. The tents of the Commanding Officer
and his staff faced the west. Fifty paces in front of
Headquarters were the tents of the line officers, and fifty
paces in front of the quarters of the line officers were the
heads of the Company streets. The tents of the men faced
south, and were five paces apart. The Company streets
were thirty paces wide. Thirty paces from the last tent
in the Company street were the Company kitchens, and
fifty paces in rear of the kitchens, were the Company
sinks. The Eighth had the longest camp front of any
Regiment in the Park, and later when sickness began to
appear in the various camps, the wisdom of this arrangement
was apparent.</p>

<p>Until May 23rd, when wagons and mules were issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to the Regiment, water was scarce. Every farm well in
the vicinity was under guard, and had a line of details
waiting for a turn at the pump handle. The wells were
pumped dry many times daily. The details remained in
line waiting for them to fill up. Chickamauga Creek was
already contaminated by drainage, and long expeditions
were made to obtain enough water for drinking and cooking
purposes.</p>

<p>With the issuing of transportation, water was hauled
for all purposes from the Blue Spring, some five miles
from camp, until the Government constructed a pipe line
and brought water to the vicinity of every camp. This
pipe line water was never used in the Regiment for drinking,
and during the whole stay of the Regiment at Chickamauga,
all drinking water was daily brought from the
Blue Spring.</p>

<p>The lack of water led to the circulation of many absurd
rumors at home. It was reported that the wells had been
poisoned by the Spanish spies, and that some had been
detected in the act and shot. The water famine was much
exaggerated in the reports from Chickamauga. The regiment
undoubtedly suffered much inconvenience at first,
but not greater than should have been expected from the
hurried manner in which the troops were brought together.</p>

<p>For some time the army mule was a source of entertainment
and worry to the regiment. The Government
issued to each regiment twenty-seven wagons and one hundred
and eight mules. Previous to this issue, these mules
were assembled in a large corral near the railroad station.
Usually, a detail of four men was sent to draw a wagon,
four mules and harnesses. The mules were turned over
to this detail, together with various parts of harnesses and
a wagon, as they came from the factory. It was the duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the detail to hold the mules and at the same time assemble
harnesses and wagon. This was new work for
most of the men, and the outfits were brought into camp
after many sad experiences. It was not unusual for the
detail to start from the corral driving in a careful manner,
but after going a mile or two without mishap, the
desire to speed a little overcame this caution, and the
mules were urged to a trot or canter. As few of these
animals had been broken, the first turn of a road presented
an opportunity for a spill.</p>

<p>There was such a turn near the camp of the Eighth,
and many of the men used to sit under the trees watching
the details from other regiments navigate their mules
around the bend. Often mules would continue on a
straight course into the woods, and bid up when some tree
separated the leaders and threw them down, with the
wheel mules and wagon piled on top. This performance
was at first a daily occurrence, and apparently resulted in
no injury to the mules or men.</p>

<p>Another source of amusement was to hire the darkies
who loafed about the camps, to break the mules. They
were usually ridden bare back, and succeeded in throwing
their riders several times before they would submit.</p>

<p>The mule quarters at first consisted of a cable stretched
from tree to tree, to which the mules were fastened by
halters. This was the practice in all the camps, and every
night each regiment lost from ten to twelve mules. The
mules usually wandered around the park until appropriated
by some Quartermaster to make up his quota.</p>

<p>After submitting for a few nights to this loss, Lieutenant
Colonel Bailey determined to construct a corral of
rails, and for this purposes obtained permission to use the
top rails of various fences along the Alexander road. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
work of construction took place on a moonlight night, and
in the morning it was discovered that the rail fences for
a long distance had disappeared, and a large area in the
camp of the Eighth was surrounded with a Virginia fence
some 12 feet high. The detail charged with the work of
construction stoutly maintained, when explanation was
demanded, that none of them had taken anything but "top
rails". With this improvised stable the Quartermaster of
the Eighth was able to maintain his supply of mules.</p>

<p>There were two entrances to this corral at which sentinels
were maintained, with orders to allow any stray
mules to go in, but none to come out. Every morning an
extra surplus of mules was found in the corral.</p>

<p>The wagon master, who was a civilian employee, and
had been hired by the Quartermaster on account of his experience
with mules, soon had his pick of all the mules in
the Park. His first duty in the morning was a readjustment
of mule property. Any surplus was held and delivered
to inquiring Quartermasters who had lost mules.
As all mules look alike to most Quartermasters, it came
to pass in the course of time, that the wagon master of the
Eighth had by far the best mule teams of any Regiment.
It was, in fact, a selection from the mules of fifty odd
regiments.</p>

<p>Apparently no one suspected this process of eliminating
poor mules, and the corral of the Eighth was looked upon
as a public benefaction, where lost mules could usually be
found and identified. The process of identification was
directed and controlled by the experienced wagon master
of the Eighth.</p>

<p>During May the evenings were delightfully cool in contrast
with the heat of the day. Work finished, with parade
and after supper, the men collected in groups to sing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
listen to the drum corps, or gossip about the future of the
regiment. Rumors of immediate moves were always in
circulation. It was generally believed that the First
Corps was destined to invest Havana in the fall, but this
belief was often shaken by rumors of orders to go to Manila,
Honolulu, Santiago, or Porto Rico. The regiment
was always expecting marching orders in the immediate
future.</p>

<p>Almost every large congregation contains some men
who need a free application of soap and water. In a
camp where many men are herded together, the personal
cleanliness of each soldier is a factor in the general health.</p>

<p>As soon as the pipe line was established, and water was
abundant, orders were issued in regard to bathing, and
were enforced by weekly inspections. The men were required
to strip in quarters, and were examined by the surgeons.
The first inspection disclosed an unfortunate who
had secreted on his person, a liberal amount of Georgia
real estate.</p>

<p>Eight husky sergeants, armed with fresh stable brooms
and soap, were detailed to accompany the victim to the
stand pipe. The detail, clad only in their birthday clothes,
marched through the camp, conducting the victim in solemn
procession, to the place of execution. The novel sight of
the naked detail and prisoner attracted many spectators
from the regiment, who observed the enforced bathing, and
materially assisted by their advice and presence the cleansing
operation. The man was washed as he had never been
washed before.</p>

<p>The result of this public exhibition deterred others
from disregarding bathing regulations. During the service
of the regiment, no other man was ever reported as
the result of these inspections, for personal uncleanliness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>At midnight on May 28th, the first death occurred in
the regiment. Private Herbert O. Burnham, Company
D, passed away at the Regimental Hospital. He contracted
pneumonia at Framingham, was taken sick on the
train, and gradually grew worse until the end came. The
next night, a second member of the command obeyed the
summons and was mustered out by death. Clarence L.
Bartol of Company C, died at the Regimental Hospital
of heart disease. The two deaths coming so close together,
produced an effect upon the men, and caused them to realize
more fully the duties of the service upon which they
had entered.</p>

<p>The regiment early established a club for the enlisted
men where they could loaf and make small purchases.
These clubs were authorized by Army Regulations, and
known as Post Exchanges or Canteens. They were managed
by a council of officers. The profits on all sales went
to the men. Regular dividends were declared and paid
to company commanders, and were accounted for by them
to the government, as a part of their company fund. Canteen
dividends could be used only to improve the ration or
condition of the men. The sale of beer and light wines
was permitted.</p>

<p>The Eighth carried on its list of Canteen supplies,
draught beer, which was furnished by a Chattanooga
brewery, together with a supply of ice sufficient to keep
the beer cool. This was the only supply of ice in camp,
and the only place where a cool drink could be had.</p>

<p>In close proximity to the Canteen, was the Y. M. C. A.
tent, which offered another home for the enlisted men
where they could read, write letters, play games, and
meet for social or religious purposes. The most excellent
young gentlemen in charge, viewed with disapproval the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
sale of beer in the rival club. The beer was also condemned
by the surgeons, on the ground that it was not up
to standard in quality, and that the poor quality of the
beer aggravated intestinal troubles.</p>

<p>One day at mess the Commanding Officer entered into
an agreement with the Y. M. C. A. representative, that
the sale of beer should be prohibited at the Canteen as long
as the Y. M. C. A. furnished for the enlisted men a barrel
of distilled ice water in front of their tent. The Regimental
Quartermaster furnished daily transportation to
Chattanooga where barrels of distilled water and ice were
purchased from the brewery company, and duly installed
by the Y. M. C. A. This supply was maintained during
the time the regiment remained at Chickamauga. The
water and ice cost as much as beer, but the expense was
borne by contributions solicited by the Y. M. C. A. manager
from the various friends of temperance in the north.</p>

<p>This substitution of water for beer gave the Colonel
some notoriety as a temperance reformer, and caused him
to receive much advice about running the regiment.</p>

<p>One lady who had devoted fifty years to the cause of
temperance, wrote a poem which she sent to the Colonel
and requested him to have the men learn it by heart and
recite it in unison as part of the ceremony at evening
parade.</p>

<p>Another friend of the cause sent a few thousand printed
pledges, with the advice that the men be required to sign
a few pledges each day and carry them in their various
pockets. She thought every time anything was taken from
a pocket, a pledge would come out, and stimulate by its
sight, each man to renewed interest to the cause of temperance.</p>

<p>The old battleground offered opportunities to the sou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>venir
hunters, and many bullets, pieces of shells and rifles
were picked up and sent home. Another craze was collecting
State buttons from the uniforms of volunteers from
various states. These buttons treated to a gold wash and
attached to a belt, were favorite souvenirs for sweethearts.</p>

<p>In addition to his duties as Battalion Commander,
Major Edward H. Eldredge was detailed as Division Inspector
of Rifle Practice. Under his supervision a rifle
range was opened near the Alexander Bridge, and twenty-seven
targets were installed. Three targets were assigned
to each regiment of the Division for daily use. Lieutenant
George W. Langdon of Company A, acted as Inspector,
and supervised the regimental work at this range. Near
the end of July, a division rifle match was shot, in which
the following scores were made:&mdash;</p>

<p>The war strength of a company in the United States
service was 106 enlisted men. Under the first call, Massachusetts
was required to furnish three batteries of
Heavy Artillery. Influence was at once brought to bear
upon the authorities at Washington to accept the First
Heavy Artillery as a Regiment of twelve batteries. To
accomplish this and keep within the quota allowed Massachusetts,
infantry companies were cut down to 74 men.
To this extent the four infantry regiments which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
raised for foreign service, were crippled to increase the
strength of the coast guard.</p>

<p>Upon the second call for volunteers, it was decided to
raise the infantry companies to full war strength of 106
men, and about the first of June the Eighth was ordered to
send a recruiting detail of three officers and twelve men to
Massachusetts for recruiting purposes. The officers in
charge of this detail were Major William Stopford, Captain
Herbert W. Whitten of Company M, and Lieutenant
Henry W. French of Company K. The detail left Chattanooga
on June 8th. The first batch of new recruits
arrived at Chickamauga on June 25th, from which time
until after the 4th of July, recruits arrived daily.</p>

<p>The average recruit who responds to the first call for
volunteers, is usually an all around better man than the
average recruit obtained upon subsequent calls. The interference
with the original Government plan of raising
four full regiments, not only weakened the regiment at
first, but later lowered its morale by introducing a poorer
class of men than could have been obtained if the companies
had recruited to a full strength at their home
stations under the first stimulus of war.</p>

<p>On June 12th the regiment had its first experience with
a Southern rain storm. After a long dry spell, the heavens
opened, and the floods descended. Innocent looking gullies
became rushing brooks, which soon overflowed their banks
and inundated many canvas homes. After the storm, a
system of drainage was inaugurated, and the men were set
to work on a main drain and connecting trenches, constructed
on lines taught by experience.</p>

<p>In the wake of the storm, and as it were, a silver lining
to the clouds, came Paymaster James C. Barr of the
Eighth Massachusetts Infantry, M. V. M., with $17,500.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
from the State of Massachusetts in payment of the men
for the time they had served at the Framingham camp.
This was the first pay the regiment received, and the paymaster
was welcomed like flowers in the spring. He was
met at the railroad station by an armed party and escorted
to camp, where his little fortune was safely guarded until
distributed in payment to the men.</p>

<p>On June 22nd Captain Walter H. Nichols of Company
H resigned, making the first break among the officers of
the regiment.</p>

<p>On June 26th the camp was stirred to excitement by
reason of an order transferring the regiment to the First
Brigade, First Division, First Army Corps. The First
Brigade was composed of the Eighth Massachusetts,
Second Wisconsin, and Fifth Illinois Regiments, and was
commanded by General Oswald Ernst. The division was
commanded by General J. M. Wilson. The Brigade was
expected to move in a few days to Newport News, where
it was to take transports for Santiago. Camp took on
new life and excitement. All superfluous baggage was
packed for storage or home shipment. The excitement
lasted a number of days, but the regiment was doomed to
disappointment, as the order was countermanded and the
regiment restored to its former place in the Third Division.</p>

<p>July 4th was observed as a holiday. Congressman
William H. Moody of the Sixth Massachusetts District,
who was spending a few days in camp, delivered a
patriotic address. A program of sports had been arranged
for the day, but the arrival of the U. S. Paymaster caused
the games to be called off. About $45,000 was paid to
the regiment, the men being paid from May 5th to June
30th. Many of the men took advantage of the arrival of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the money for a trip to Chattanooga, where they passed
the remainder of the day visiting the city or Lookout
Mountain. In the evening there was a mammoth bonfire
in camp, red fire was burned, and the drum corps gave a
concert of patriotic airs, in celebration of the victory of
Sampson over the fleet of Cevera off Santiago, the news
of which was received that afternoon.</p>

<p>As the summer advanced, and the heat increased,
reveille was sounded at 4.30 and drills were held at a correspondingly
early hour, so that by the middle of the
morning, all drills were over.</p>

<p>Soon after arriving in camp, the brigade was practiced
in extended order and the use of cover. This drill was
known to the men as "snake drill." Major Parker, of the
Twelfth New York, a Regular Army officer, acted as instructor
at first. Before many weeks the regiment became
proficient in advancing on a position, and at the same time
taking advantage of natural cover. On several occasions
the regiment gave exhibitions for the benefit of officers of
other organizations.</p>

<p>The evening parade was usually witnessed by many
spectators. The field where it was held was near the
camps of the Third Army Corps, and the men from this
organization usually assembled to watch the ceremony.
The drum corps had been increased to forty-seven pieces,
and became celebrated for its military marches.</p>

<p>The men, early in the summer, discarded the blue
uniform for brown canvas, and with the ponchos worn
white side out in a yoke from the left shoulder, presented
in ranks a natty and business-like appearance. Their drill
and marching was excellent, and upon all ceremonies and
reviews they created a most favorable impression.</p>

<p>On July 8th Captain Jacob C. R. Peabody arrived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
camp and assumed command of Company H. On July
11th Assistant Surgeon Thomas L. Jenkins resigned.</p>

<p>Late on July 14th, news was received that Santiago
had fallen. A celebration was promptly inaugurated. The
three regiments in the brigade interchanged marching
calls, headed by their band or field music. As the Eighth
marched through the camp of the Twelfth New York
singing patriotic songs, they were received with a novel
illumination, a man stood at the entrance of each tent
holding a lighted candle. In the camp of the Twenty-First
Kansas, speeches were made by the Colonels of both
regiments, after which the Eighth returned to its camp.</p>

<p>On July 21st the camp was again stirred by the report
that the regiment had been selected for Porto Rico, and
would embark in a few days. There was much activity
in camp securing requisitions for the men. General
Brooke, who commanded the First Corps, left for Porto
Rico, and some of the regiments of the corps reached that
Island before the order was countermanded.</p>

<p>The dull routine of camp life, repeated disappointments
in orders to move, continued excessive heat, rain
and mud, and the prevalence of camp diseases, were fast
impairing the efficiency of the First Corps. General
Breckenridge who succeeded General Wade in command,
immediately planned to break the monotony by a practice
march. The Third Division was ordered on a march into
Tennessee, and a detail was sent in advance to secure
camp sites.</p>

<p>Pending this general movement, the Eighth was granted
permission to make a short march to Pea Vine Ridge. The
start was made at daybreak on July 19th along the Ringgold
Pike, which had been traveled by Sherman in his
march to Atlanta. The morning was spent in advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
guard work. The farmers along the route cherished unpleasant
memories of Northern troops, and spent their
time guarding live stock while the regiment remained in
the vicinity. Camp was made at noon near the Craven
House, and the afternoon was devoted to play. Many of
the men dammed a mountain brook and spent the afternoon
splashing in its pools.</p>

<p>The Craven House was occupied by an old sailor from
Newburyport, Massachusetts, who had ended his sea days
many years before, and had settled with a Georgia wife
in the Pea Vine Valley. The old gentleman was filled
with enthusiasm to see the regiment, when he learned it
was from Massachusetts, and had a company from old
Newburyport. Unfortunately Company A had been left
in Chickamauga as a camp guard. After the camp was
established, the Colonel called to pay his respects. The
excitement of the day had been too much for the old gentleman,
and he was found stricken with apoplexy.</p>

<p>The neighbors were too busy watching their property
to render assistance, and a detail from the regiment cared
for the old gentleman until he died that night.</p>

<p>As the day wore on and no raids were made by the
Northern troops upon barns or hen houses, the farmers
allowed their curiosity to overcome their fears, and visited
camp. They were soon selling peaches, butter milk and
sweet potato pies to the troops. These pies were christened
"rubbernecks" by the men, and were held in light esteem,
although heavy as lead.</p>

<p>On July 23rd all the state knapsacks were condemned.
They were little box affairs, covered with enamel leather,
and had seen service at many a Framingham muster. They
were piled at the head of each company street and burned.
Blanket bags were later issued and were more acceptable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
The tents brought from Massachusetts had been earlier
condemned as unserviceable, and were replaced by a new
issue.</p>

<p>August 1st, Lieutenant George N. Jewett of Company
H resigned.</p>

<p>On August 9th the regiment was presented with a new
set of colors. During its term of service it had three sets,
two furnished by Massachusetts, and one drawn from the
Government Quartermaster's department. The Regimental
flag furnished by the Quartermaster's department, bore
the coat of arms of the United States upon a blue field.
This flag was rarely carried, and is the only one of its
kind in the collection of flags carried by Massachusetts
regiments, preserved at the State House.</p>

<p>By the middle of August the camp in the woods was
water logged. Continual rain had saturated the soil. The
drains took care of surface water, but as there <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'was no sepage'">was no
seepage</ins> through the clay the drains were powerless to carry
off the mass of water imprisoned in the soil, and for
which evaporation was the only escape. Rain and evaporation
were in equilibrium. The mud on the legs of the
men like mercury in a thermometer, registered the fluctuation
from this equilibrium. Ordinary rubbers were useless,
and sometimes rubber boots were inundated.</p>

<p>Although the Government had furnished no lumber for
tent floors, the men had quite generally appropriated
means to raise their beds above the ground. The larceny
of boards was encouraged as a sanitary virtue. A few
buildings which the Park authorities cherished as ancient
landmarks, about which the tide of the great battle ebbed
and flowed in 1863, has entirely disappeared. The companies
of the Third Battalion had purchased lumber at
Chattanooga and constructed tent floors. The quarters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the enlisted men were on the highest ridge and were less
exposed. The quarters of the Colonel and Staff were approachable
only through a sea of liquid mud, and were
shifted onto higher ground.</p>

<p>Application was repeatedly made for permission to
change the camp. The order for a change came just before
the regiment moved to Lexington. The First Battalion
was the only unit to occupy the new camp, which was
located in an open field on the eastern side of the Alexander
Bridge road.</p>

<p>On August 19th Lieutenant Roland H. Sherman of
Company L, resigned and was discharged.</p>

<p>In order to fill the vacancies in the line officers of the
regiment, the following promotions were made while at
Chickamauga: Second Lieutenant Augustus G. Reynolds
was promoted to first lieutenant in Company H, and
First Sergeant Thomas O. H. Pineau of that company was
commissioned second lieutenant. First Sergeant Eugene
Larrivee, of Company L, was commissioned second lieutenant
in that company.</p>

<p>On August 21st orders were received to furlough all
sick men, as the regiment was to leave Chickamauga. Some
two hundred furloughs were issued. On the night of
August 22nd a huge bonfire in camp celebrated the last
night at Chickamauga. Early the next morning camp
was broken, and the regiment marched to Rossville,
Georgia, where it entrained early in the morning and was
enroute to the blue grass region of Kentucky. Chickamauga
was left with no regrets.</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i083.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The prevailing sickness at Chickamauga was
diarrhœa, dysentery and typhoid. During the
spring and summer about 80,000 men passed
through the park, but there were probably
never over 50,000 encamped there at any one time. The
board which investigated the sanitary conditions of 44,803
men at Camp Thomas, reported 9,960 probable cases of
typhoid, and 713 fatal results from this disease. One man
in every five suffered from this fever, and almost every
man was afflicted with some intestinal disorder. Much has
been said as to whether this suffering was preventable,
and was due to ignorance and neglect, or was paid as the
necessary price of war.</p>

<p>In the first call for troops the War Department expressed
a desire that the States should give preference
among volunteers to National Guard organizations, in the
expectation that they were equipped and had been prepared
for war by a previous training.</p>

<p>Massachusetts perhaps, satisfied this expectation as
fully as any state. Her regiments were at least uniformed,
armed, and equipped with means for preparing food, but
they had no experience in caring for themselves in the
field. The Government ration consisted of bread, coffee,
potatoes, onions, canned tomatoes, fresh beef seven days,
and bacon three days out of ten. One hundred rations
were sufficient in quantity to feed one hundred men one
day, but this required careful management on the part of
company commanders, and proper preparation by company
cooks. Any system of training men for the field should
make provision for accustoming men to live, and live
comfortably upon this ration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not an answer to say that the United States Army
in time of peace, does not live upon this ration, but supplements
it by purchases from their company funds. A
volunteer regiment going into the United States service,
will have no company funds, and must live on the ration
until companies accumulate funds, which ordinarily would
be impossible in the field. Any system of training which
fails to recognize this fact is false in theory and practice.</p>

<p>Previous to the Spanish War, the Massachusetts Militia
were fed by caterers at their summer outings. There was
a Commissary Department, but its officers were appointed
for other reasons than efficiency and experience in handling
supplies. Some states had commissary departments
which furnished rations, and required the companies to
prepare the food, but there was no where any systematic
attempt to train men to manage and support life upon the
Government ration.</p>

<p>Resulting from a lack of previous experience, the Massachusetts
regiments suffered during the first six months of
their field service. Men were starving in the regiments,
because unable to assimilate the Government ration,
which, through a lack of experience in handling and preparing,
was served to them in a form which did not
properly nourish, and aggravated and perpetuated the
ordinary intestinal troubles which recruits usually experience
when first taking the field. Many men were
improperly nourished, their vitality lowered, and their
power of resisting disease impaired. So far as this resulted
from a defect in their militia training, the State
of Massachusetts was responsible.</p>

<p>For a number of years the Massachusetts Militia had
been equipped for eye service. The men were supplied
with the equipments they could carry on their person, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
which contributed to the success of a parade, by giving it
a ready-for-war appearance. Not much attention was paid
to other equipments.</p>

<p>There was a limited supply of blankets, ponchos, buzzacotts
and tentage, but not enough for all the troops. These
were held at the Framingham Arsenal, and did duty for
a mysterious field equipment, ready for instant use. There
were no shelter tents or wagons. Some of the supplies
were of a stage property kind. The shovels carried by an
improvised pioneer corps in one of the Boston street
parades, lasted two hours when used for digging by a
detachment of the Eighth. The Militia of Massachusetts
had never been properly equipped for field service.</p>

<p>The appropriation of $500,000 by the Legislature in
April, enabled them to take the field better supplied than
the Guard Regiments from many states, but they were
never fully equipped by the State, or instructed in the
A B C of a soldier's duty.</p>

<p>They had been assembled for years in brigade camps,
and taught ceremonies and parades, but no attempt had
been made to teach company commanders the important
lesson of how to meet the requirements of the field, and
care for their men under service conditions. The increasing
sick list reported in all the camps, accentuated
this absence of individual experience and trained company
officers.</p>

<p>The War Department was as unprepared as the Militia
of Massachusetts. The machinery for handling an army
of 26,000 men in peace, was called upon to mobilize
275,000 men of war. It was altogether inadequate to
meet the emergency. There were practically no reserve
supplies. On April 23rd the Government had enough
Springfield rifles to equip the volunteers, but that was all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The cloth of the uniforms first issued to some regiments
at Chickamauga, was not manufactured when the regiments
were mustered into service.</p>

<p>Large quantities of commissary supplies were purchased
in the market, and rushed to the large camps for concentration.
These supplies were uniformly of standard
quality, and were accumulated in sufficient quantities at
the depots, but were often delayed in distribution to the
troops. Volunteer officers were at first unacquainted with
the use of requisition blanks, and the red tape of Government
issue, and the Commissary Department lacked facilities
to make prompt and full deliveries. This was the
earliest department, however, to get into working order,
and subsequent complaints at Chickamauga were due to
the inexperience of officers and men in handling the
rations.</p>

<p>The Quartermaster's Department also made large purchases
in the market, but were handicapped by having to
wait for articles to be manufactured to fill orders. This
department at Chickamauga was further handicapped by
inefficiency and failure to appreciate the situation, and the
necessary requirements of the troops.</p>

<p>As soon as wagon transportation was issued to the
Eighth, they began to bring the water from the Blue
Spring. This was a long haul, and required many barrels
for transportation and storage in camp. The supply of barrels
issued by the Quartermaster's Department to the
regiment was inadequate. The Chief Quartermaster was
repeatedly requested to furnish sufficient barrels for this
purpose, and refused. The regiment subsequently purchased,
at its own expense, at Chattanooga, sufficient receptacles.</p>

<p>The refusal of the Chief Quartermaster was reported to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the Inspector General's Department, and was thus commented
upon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"One of the principal appeals made to me during the
many inspections that I made was for water barrels and
boilers, so that the strict order to boil all drinking water
might be complied with. I made several trips to the
office of the chief quartermaster in behalf of the command
on this matter, but without success. I finally went to the
corps commander, and he told me to go again to the chief
quartermaster, who told me that the regiments had as
many as 15 water barrels to each regiment (twelve companies),
and the water being hauled from four to seven
miles. This reply convinced me at once of a total failure
to appreciate the condition of affairs, what was required,
and what should be done. Owing to a failure of this
department to provide the proper shelter, supplies, and
clothing, I am satisfied that much of the sickness was
caused.</p>

<p>The whole matter sums itself up in this, that the
regulations necessary for the conduct of a small army during
a period of thirty-five years of peace, when built upon
and expanded into those required for an army ten times
as large in time of war, failed absolutely and went to
pieces."</p></div>

<p>The Regimental Commander repeatedly asked the
Quartermaster's Department for disinfectants and lumber;
these requisitions were disallowed. Whatever supplies
of this nature the regiment had, were purchased by
private contribution, until the spread of disease excited
public indignation and demanded liberal issues. After
official investigation began, a change was noticed in the
policy of the department. By the end of the summer it
is probable that porcelain lined bath tubs would have been
issued for the mere asking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>During the hot summer months, 75 per cent. of the men
at Chickamauga were forced to wear heavy woolen clothing.
The Eighth was the only regiment fully equipped
with canvas suits. These had been purchased by the
State of Massachusetts. If sufficient energy had been displayed
by the Quartermaster's Department, the same
clothing would have been purchased and issued to all the
regiments. What supplies were on hand were held in
small storehouses, and their issues blocked by lack of system
and necessary labor to handle the goods.</p>

<p>The Medical Department at Chickamauga was inefficient
and displayed lack of both professional and executive
ability. There was an unnecessary shortage of medical
supplies and hospital attendants. No provision was at
first made for general hospitals. The sick were cared for
in regimental hospitals, and later when these were
abolished, in Division Hospitals. Division hospitals are
organized to accompany troops in the field, and serve as
a collecting station, where the injured receive temporary
treatment and are transferred as soon as practicable to
general hospitals.</p>

<p>The field hospitals at Chickamauga were swarmed with
the sick, and were forced to become general hospitals, as
no other provision had been made. The accommodations
were inadequate. Hospital tents were insufficient in number,
and were not supplied with proper furnishings. There
was a lack of medicine and nourishing food. The nurses
were enlisted men detailed from the various regiments,
and were ignorant of their duties, and without experience.</p>

<p>The quarters and grounds were dirty, and the service
was undisciplined, disorganized and demoralized. Until
taken firmly in hand by General Sanger and reorganized,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the Third Division Hospital was a monument to the ignorance
and incapacity of the Medical Department.</p>

<p>This Department was thus described in an inspection
report:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"I found quite a number of sick in each regiment, and
was informed by the regimental surgeons that they could
not get from the medical depot those medicines and other
supplies needed for the sick, and was also informed that,
in reply to their request, they were told that no issue of
medicine or medical supplies could be had from the depot
until the field cases were filled; that, although the medicines
were on hand, it was not the intention to make issues
until everything could be done in the order required by
the Army Regulations, resulting in unnecessary discomfort
and suffering to the sick. The different aid societies
did a great deal toward helping out the unfortunate conditions,
but on the whole, the administration of the affairs
of this department was a dismal failure. Those regimental
medical officers bought a great deal of medicine with their
own funds and from funds furnished them by their friends
at home. There were no cots, blankets, pillows, nor sheets.
The medicine and medical supplies were entirely inadequate
for many days after my reporting for duty. There
were no floors in the tents where the sick were. They
were crowded together in dangerous proximity to each
other, and those gentlemen of the medical profession of
the volunteer service were very bitter in their denunciations
of our miserable system."</p></div>

<p>The medical officers of the Eighth were at all times
zealous and efficient in instructing officers how to combat
disease, and the regimental officers were intelligent and
active in carrying out these instructions.</p>

<p>Before typhoid became epidemic, Colonel Pew assembled
officers and men after evening parade, and explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to them the nature and cause of this fever. He said this
disease had already broken out, and he anticipated it
would become a scourge to the troops, because of the unsanitary
condition of the various camps. That it was
caused by microscopic germs found in the discharges of
the sick. That these germs were very tenacious of life,
and increased and multiplied rapidly in filth. That when
dry they would drift about in the air and lodge on food,
clothing or the person. That they were harmless unless
taken into the mouth, but as they were too small to be seen,
there was always danger of contagion. That they were
killed by boiling, and for that reason the men would be
required to drink only boiled water, and keep their food
protected against dust. That all human excreta must be
deposited in the proper place, and covered with a paddle,
as Moses taught the children of Israel to care for themselves
in the Wilderness. That police regulations would
be enforced, and camp conditions made as unfavorable as
possible for the growth and development of these germs.
He urged the men to appreciate the danger to which they
were exposed, and to avoid it by complying strictly with
all sanitary regulations.</p>

<p>The Medical Board appointed to examine into the
causes of the existence and spread of typhoid in the
national camp of 1898, reported that this fever was
brought to Camp Thomas by the volunteers, and spread by
the neglect of the rules of sanitation and military hygiene.
Out of forty-eight regiments whose medical records were
examined, nine regiments reached Chickamauga with developed
cases of typhoid, twenty-five regiments developed
cases within two weeks, and at the expiration of one month
only two regiments of the forty-eight were free from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
disease. The first case of typhoid in the Eighth Regiment
was reported July 13.</p>

<p>The average volunteer at Chickamauga had little discipline,
and a slight knowledge of sanitation. He was willing
to fight, as he had enlisted for that purpose, but he
rather resented as an invasion of personal rights, any
attempt to dictate what he should eat or drink. He did
not accept in full faith the germ theory of disease, and
was skeptical about the existence of bugs he could not see.</p>

<p>If water looked clear and was cool, he was unwilling
to believe it was unwholesome, especially when it tasted
sweet and satisfied his cravings. He was willing to believe
that any water in which fish could swim, was good
to drink, or to accept any other absurd test which was
current.</p>

<p>The experience of an outpost from the regiment illustrates
the chances intelligent college men would take,
when it became a question of satisfying the appetite. This
outpost was established on the banks of Chickamauga
Creek, below the inflow of camp sewerage, and obtained
their drinking water from a spring bubbling up in the
slope of the bank. A sudden rain caused the creek to rise
and submerge the spring. After the water subsided, the
outpost discovered the surface of the spring covered with
slime.</p>

<p>Someone suggested bad germs floated, and acting upon
this theory, they plunged a canteen to the bottom of the
spring, with the opening stopped by the thumb against the
entrance of bacteria. When the canteen was on the bottom,
the thumb was removed until the canteen was filled,
the opening was then again plugged with the thumb, and
the supply brought to the surface. Every member of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
outpost was stricken with typhoid as a result of this experiment.</p>

<p>Although orders had been issued to drink only boiled
water, most men in the corps drank what they pleased.
Unsatisfactory rations led many men to patronize the
various food venders. Near the railroad station a swarm
of booths sprung up, where all kinds of food were dispensed.
These stands were not subject to medical
inspection, and later were denounced by the Medical
Department as sources of contagion.</p>

<p>The chief sources of contagion were company sinks.
Digging and caring for sinks did not appeal to the men
as heroic soldiering. They hated and shirked this duty and
as a result the sinks of many regiments were so repulsive
that the men refused to use them, and polluted territory
surrounding the camp.</p>

<p>The care of the sinks was always a matter of great
solicitude to the officers of the Eighth. Their cleanliness
was insisted upon at all times with martinet rigidity, and
men were punished for not using them, after the formality
of a trial and conviction before a summary court.</p>

<p>It was recognized that these pest holes might become
breeding grounds of flies which would infest the camp and
carry contagion. The following extract from a circular
shows to what extent this danger was appreciated.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"No doubt typhoid fever, camp diarrhœa, and probably
yellow fever are frequently communicated to soldiers in
camp through the agency of flies, which swarm about
fecal matter and filth of all kinds deposited upon the
ground or in shallow pits and directly convey infectious
material, attached to their feet or contained in their
excreta, to the food which is exposed while being prepared
at the company kitchens or while being served in the mess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
tent. It is for this reason that a strict sanitary police is
so important."</p></div>

<p>Although the Eighth prevented flies breeding in its
own camp, it could not prevent them swarming from
other camps and spreading contagion. Flies increased
and multiplied. A roast of beef exposed for a few
minutes looked as black as a mass of charcoal, so dense was
its surface packed with flies. Netting was purchased, and
an attempt was made to keep all food covered. Some of
the officers constructed mess quarters of scantlings covered
with fly screens.</p>

<p>For two months the Eighth Regiment, fully realizing
the danger to which it was exposed, fought against
typhoid and combated it with intelligence and energy.
During the last two months of its stay at Chickamauga,
it was smitten with a heavy hand, and became the
victims of a system which failed to furnish sanitary safeguards
against the spread of communicable disease.</p>

<p>Digging was at all times difficult in the territory of the
Eighth, as the soil was a hard clay and the outcropping
ledges caused the abandonment of many sink holes when
half dug. When the rainy season began a new danger
threatened the regiment. The sinks would fill with water
and stay full. Refilling the holes with lumps of clay that
had been taken out, would cause an overflow and pollute
the surrounding ground. Sinks had to be abandoned after
every heavy rain, and new holes dug.</p>

<p>The ground in the rear of the camp was filled with open
pits in which polluted water stagnated. It was noticed
that this stagnant water became the breeding ground for
insects. The ingenuity of the officers was taxed to invent
a method of sealing these sinks. A happy suggestion oc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>curred
to a group of officers who had been in the habit of
dining at an Italian Restaurant in Boston. They had
seen flasks of Chianti sealed with a few spoonfuls of olive
oil, and the analogy suggested oil to seal the sinks against
insect life. A can of kerosene was secured, and the experiment
tried.</p>

<p>As the oil spread over the surface of the water, it was
noticed that it apparently interfered with the comfort of
the wigglers, as they came to the surface. Crude petroleum
was suggested as being stickier than refined oil, and
a can was procured in Chattanooga and tried. Experiments
showed that this oil often imprisoned the mother
insect when laying eggs, and was a complete bar through
which the wigglers, when grown, could not penetrate and
emerge from the pits. Crude petroleum was purchased
by the barrel and used in these open sinks.</p>

<p>From the Eighth Regiment the use of petroleum spread
through the First and Third Corps, and subsequently became
recognized throughout the country as a means of
destroying mosquitoes and other insects that breed in
stagnant waters.</p>

<p>The efforts which were made by the Eighth Regiment
to maintain a sanitary camp, were recognized in the report
of Colonel A. A. Woodhull, Deputy Surgeon General, U.
S. A., on conditions in Camp George H. Thomas. Under
the various sub-headings of his report, he refers to the
regiment as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Under the sub-heading "Water Supply" he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"There are general instructions to boil all water,
whether filtered or not. In the only regiment where I
could be sure the order was actually enforced (Eighth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Massachusetts), no typhoid has yet been recognized, and
although the camp is very low and wet and remittant fever
has occurred within the last fortnight, the general sick
rate is only 2.56 per cent."</p></div>

<p>Under sub-heading "Character of Troops" he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"The dirty camps are the sickly camps here as elsewhere.
But discipline and intelligence have their reward
also. Without specifying instances low in the scale, attention
is invited to the Eighth Massachusetts, already
cited, where the positive enforcement of orders by punitive
measures when necessary has resulted in the actual use of
only boiled water for drinking, with exemption from
typhoid fever and a low sick rate as a probable consequence."</p></div>

<p>Again, under the heading "Third Division, First
Corps" he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"The Eighth Massachusetts, whose discipline is good
and which boils its water, has a sick rate of 2.56, although
its camp site is bad."</p></div>

<p>Some of the volunteers were handicapped by the qualities
of their officers. The American soldier responds to
sympathetic leadership, but not to the sympathy that
expresses itself in exaggeration of his hardships, and in
frequent reference to his woes. This kind of talk destroys
the back bone of resistance, and makes a company a mob
of weaklings.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">It is easy enough to be pleasant</p>
<p class="verse">When life moves along like a song,</p>
<p class="verse">But the man worth while is the man with a smile,</p>
<p class="verse">When everything goes dead wrong.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>General Chaffee has said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"Soldier's do not like sympathy; sympathy is for women
and children. Soldiers are men, but they do like fair
commendation when deserving of it, and especially when
their fortitude has been severely tested. Commend our
soldiers for manfully undergoing privations and they will
readily respond again; but prate of their privations, deficiencies,
and heavy burdens, and they soon learn to dread
the hour that shall disturb their ease; the spirit becomes
one of submission rather than one cheerfully embracing
the opportunity to exhibit their endurance and their
stamina."</p></div>

<p>The strength of the Eighth lay in the manhood of her
officers and men, who were ready with a determined smile
to face any game into which they were called.</p>

<p>A commission appointed by the President to investigate
the sanitary conditions of the military camps of 1898
reported early in 1899. The report contains an allusion
to the Eighth Massachusetts. It says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"The intelligent and watchful supervision on the part
of the surgeons and regimental officers, and the observance
of the well established rules of camp sanitation shown by
the record of the Eighth Massachusetts Volunteers at
Camp Thomas, is very commendable. This regiment was
for many weeks very healthy, while much sickness was
occurring in regiments near by, although the camp site,
water and drill were practically the same."</p></div>

<p>This was a great compliment to the volunteer regimental
commander and his officers.</p>

<p>In some of the camps in the United States, no thoroughly
well established rules of sanitation were observed. Little
restriction was placed on drunkenness and immorality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Soldiers did not seem to care how they lived, and their
officers did not watch or teach them. Frequently the food
was poorly cared for, and badly cooked, and the men were
permitted to eat and drink anything and everything they
could find. Sickness naturally followed in regiments
where laxity prevailed.</p>

<p>The Eighth, according to evidence before the commission,
followed just the opposite plan. Discipline was strict
and impartial, and the health of the troops consequently
of the best. They were a source of much admiration to
all who saw them, both at Camp Thomas and the other
places. No other regiment in the whole American army
was similarly favored in the Commissioner's report.</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i101.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The Kentucky home of the Eighth was about
five miles from Lexington on a knoll between
the Bryan Pike and the Kentucky &amp; Eastern
Railroad. Access to the city and its markets
was over the Pike or by rail from the station of Montrose,
a few hundred yards away. A pipe line connecting with
the city supply, brought water to the foot of every company
street. Lumber was to be had upon requisition, and
abundant facilities were offered for being and keeping
well. The sun penetrating to every corner of the camp,
dried the seeds of disease, and the breezes from the hay
and clover fields blew away and dissipated the germs. The
expanding green and golden fields rolling into distant
stretches, rested eyes accustomed to the damp and closed
woods of Georgia.</p>

<p>Men depressed by the atmosphere of Chickamauga,
opened their eyes upon a new world, and began to experience
the joy of living. The place, time of year, and the
intelligent efforts of officers to stamp out disease, backed
by unlimited Government supplies, infused new life into
the tired and jaded regiments of the Third Division.
General Sanger was indefatigable in his efforts to restore
health, and was loyally supported by the line and medical
officers.</p>

<p>It was not given to the Eighth, however, to overcome
at once the results of their long stay at Chickamauga,
surrounded by infection. For months they had fought
contagion, and kept typhoid at bay, but were finally
powerless against the swarm of flies that overspread their
camp, depositing bacteria upon food and clothing. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
regiment left Chickamauga inoculated with poison, and
during the first few weeks at Lexington, enteric fever
broke out and was more prevalent than at any other
period.</p>

<p>For a month the energies of the regiment were devoted
to getting down to the bed rock of health. Sources of
contagion were destroyed or removed. At sick call, men
with abnormal temperatures were removed from their
comrades, and sent to the general hospital. Suspicious
cases were held under observation until the outcome was
known. Sick men who might be a source of new contagion,
were at once separated from the regiment, and so thoroughly
was this work done, that more than half the
regiment was away from the colors.</p>

<p>A systematic crusade was made against the old germs
that had traveled with the regiment from Chickamauga
hid in blankets, clothing or personal belongings. Corrosive
sublimate and chlorinated lime were freely used.</p>

<p>Clothing and blankets were boiled, brushed, and hung
up for sunshine and wind to work through. All excreta was
collected in closed sinks from which flies were excluded,
and germ life was poisoned with chemical agents.</p>

<p>Tent floors were daily washed with corrosive sublimate,
and weekly stood on end for the under side to be dried and
white washed. Location of tents were frequently changed,
and the uncovered ground thoroughly treated with lime.
The camp was thoroughly drained, policed, and was as
near medically clean as the science of military hygiene
permitted.</p>

<p>As soon as possible a new issue of tentage was obtained,
and those used at Chickamauga were destroyed. Each
tent was furnished with a floor, and wooden sleeping
bunks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Sales by pedlers were regulated by orders from
Division Headquarters. Chickamauga Park had been
overrun by fakirs selling cakes, pies and other foods, much
of which was believed to have been contaminated, and to
have materially contributed to the spread of camp diseases.
As soon as the food pedlers appeared in the new camp,
they were rounded up by the guard and expelled. Certain
permits were issued, regulating the sale of foods. Pedlers
were required to report to the Officer of the Day, and conduct
their business under his direction and supervision.</p>

<p>Many men suffering from intestinal troubles, could not
assimilate the sturdy Government ration, and large quantities
of milk and eggs were daily needed for their
nourishment. Such perishable articles were not furnished
by the Government, and company commanders had to
depend upon the company fund for their purchase.</p>

<p>The sale of beer was the chief source of revenue to the
Canteen, and was accordingly resorted to. A commodious
wooden building was erected as a Post Exchange, and a
large ice box was constructed, where gallons of milk and
hundreds of eggs were stored. Captain Horace S. Bean,
of Company B, was put in charge of the Canteen, and
made large purchases from the neighboring farmers. The
favorite tipple served over the bar was a milk and egg
shake. Many of the company commanders served <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'an egg nogg'">an egg
nog</ins> to each man at 10 A. M. and 4 P. M. daily. The
best quality of beer was obtained from Milwaukee, and
was hereafter retained as a regular Canteen supply, while
the regiment remained in the service.</p>

<p>The profit on the sale of beer became a material factor
in building up the health of the regiment, and augmenting
the company funds. At one time over three thousand dollars
was divided among companies as a Canteen dividend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>A new hospital tent was received from the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Massachuchusetts Volunteer'">Massachusetts
Volunteer</ins> Aid Association, and was pitched on
the left flank of the regiment. As the regimental hospital
had been abolished, this was used as a dispensary. All
soldiers requiring treatment reported to the dispensary,
where their case was diagnosed by the regimental surgeon,
and if it was found that the patient was in a condition
requiring treatment, he was immediately sent to the
Division hospital.</p>

<p>This was known as the John Blair Gibbs Hospital, and
was situated about a mile from camp. It was presided
over by a competent staff of skilled surgeons, assisted by
a corps of trained nurses, from whom the men received
excellent treatment.</p>

<p>During this period of recuperation, furloughs were
freely given. This privilege was sometimes abused, and
some men without any ailment, except a desire to go home,
managed to pass the surgeons and secure a furlough. The
"furlough walk" and "furlough face" came to be recognized
as evidence of homesickness, and was more or less joked
about among the men as means of obtaining a furlough.
Nearly all the men, however, who were sent home, needed
a change, and were granted furloughs as a sanitary precaution.</p>

<p>Lexington had been the home of Henry Clay, and as a
compliment to the city, the camp was named Camp Henry
Clay, in honor of the Kentucky statesman. This name
was subsequently changed, as the War Department had
adopted the practice of naming the camps in honor of
soldiers who had fallen in the Spanish War, to Camp
J. M. Hamilton, in honor of an officer in the Ninth United
States Infantry, who fell at Santiago.</p>

<p>The "P jacket" first appeared in the regiment at Camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Hamilton. Previous to its introduction, one unacquainted
with military affairs, could not distinguish prisoners from
other soldiers.</p>

<p>These jackets were a distinctive badge. They were a
blue jumper with a large capital P painted in white upon
the back, and a smaller letter P, and the prisoner's number
painted upon the arm.</p>

<p>It was related that a party of young ladies visiting the
camp, became very much interested in these uniforms; but
not understanding the letter P, inquired its significance
from one of the prisoners, and was smilingly told that it
stood for "Perfect," and that the jacket was a badge of
honor.</p>

<p>The condition of the regiment was a source of great
solicitude to its friends at home, and many anxious inquiries
were made as to its health and surroundings. On
September 8th, Mayor Ramsdell of Lynn, visited the
camp and remained a number of days. He was the first
of several Northern people who visited the camp to inquire
into and report upon the condition of the troops.</p>

<p>On September 8th, the camp was visited by a delegation
from Massachusetts, headed by Colonel Benjamin S.
Lovell of Weymouth, of the military committee of Governor
Wolcott's council. This trip was the result of a
story printed in a Cincinnati paper, to the effect that the
Eighth was demoralized with typhoid fever.</p>

<p>Colonel Lovell and others, who were in attendance at
the national encampment of the G. A. R., in the Ohio
city, saw the report in the paper, and Colonel Lovell telegraphed
for authority to proceed to Lexington and make
an investigation, and permission was granted by Governor
Wolcott.</p>

<p>A special car was chartered, and Colonel Lovell, Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
William M. Olin, secretary of the commonwealth, a
veteran of the Civil War, who camped at Lexington in
those stirring days, Captain J. G. B. Adams, sergeant-at-arms
of the Massachusetts legislature, himself a past
commander-in-chief of the G. A. R., accompanied by Mrs.
L. A. Turner, prominent in Women's Relief Corps
circles, and other Massachusetts people, made the trip to
Lexington.</p>

<p>The day was spent in looking over the regiment, and
Colonel Lovell, Colonel Olin and Captain Adams, made a
thorough inspection of the regiment and its conditions, in
regard to food, sanitary arrangements, and especially in
regard to sickness. Colonel Lovell made a report to the
governor upon his return home, and the same is on file
at the State House, although it could not be located at the
time this chapter was written.</p>

<p>At the close of the day, the entire party went back to
Cincinnati, satisfied that the report was greatly exaggerated
by the newspaper which had published the story,
as there was but little typhoid among the men.</p>

<p>On September 12th, Mayor Chase of Haverhill, also
visited the camp, being the guest of Company F of that
city.</p>

<p>The troops quartered in and about Lexington were the
Eighth Massachusetts, Twelfth New York, Twenty-First
Kansas, One Hundred and Sixtieth Indiana, Third Kentucky,
Fourth Kentucky, Third Mississippi, Second Missouri,
Seventh United States Immunes, colored, Eighth
United States Immunes, colored. On September 26th, the
Twenty-First Kansas left for Fort Leavenworth, to be
mustered out of the service, and upon the day following
their place was taken by the First Territorial Regiment.
This regiment was enlisted from the territories of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Mexico, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Indian Territory, and
was composed of ranchmen, cowboys, and some Indians.
Their initial appearance in the camp of the Eighth was
explosive. As soon as a camp site had been assigned them,
and they were dismissed, they started on a round of visits
to the various camps. The visit was made upon the run,
accompanied by a continuous yelling and whooping. This
whirlwind of noise passed through every company street
in the New York and Massachusetts regiments without
stopping, and disappeared to repeat the performance in the
camps of other regiments. The most orderly member of
the command was a large brown bear, which did duty as
regimental mascot.</p>

<p>Some amusement was furnished one evening as the men
assembled for parade, by a barouche containing four ladies
of the town, driven by a stately colored man. They disappeared
in the camp of the Twelfth New York, but
shortly returned with the large letters I. C., in chalk on
the back of the carriage.</p>

<p>The camp site of the Eighth had formerly been cultivated,
but during the summer the land had run to weeds.
These were waist high until mowed. During one of the
early changes of guard, the old guard was marched by the
Lieutenant through some of these weeds, towards the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'regiimental parade'">regimental
parade</ins>, where they were to be dismissed. Suddenly
the guard broke ranks, and each man rushed for his
quarters. The Lieutenant stopped in amazement and
shouted to his men, "What in blank are you running for"?
Before he got an answer, a swarm of hornets attached
themselves to his person, and he was soon running as fast
as any member of his guard.</p>

<p>The men were encouraged to engage in sports as a
recreation. At one time, foot ball was taken up in a mild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
way, but after the Kentucky State College defeated Company
H by a score of 59 to 0, interest in this strenuous
sport died out.</p>

<p>Lexington was well supplied with entertainment, and on
several occasions enlisted men attended the theatre and
circus in a body.</p>

<p>Two evenings were known at the Opera House as Eighth
Regiment nights, when the drum corps took part in the
performance, and a large delegation from the regiment
was represented in the audience.</p>

<p>The drum corps was well received throughout the south,
and their rendering of Dixie was always greeted with
Southern yells of approval.</p>

<p>On one occasion Company L was entertained at the home
of Mrs. Kate Breen, where Lieutenant Breen, Inspector of
Rifle Practice of the Ninth Massachusetts Infantry, was
visiting. He acted as host, and left with the men a
pleasant memory of his hospitality.</p>

<p>Dr. Horace B. Frost, of Boston, joined the regiment
here, having been commissioned Assistant Surgeon, with
the rank of Lieutenant, vice Jenkins, resigned.</p>

<p>The people of Lexington were most courteous and kind
to the regiment. Many homes were opened, and the genial
social life was welcomed as a help in making officers and
men contented. On September 24th, the regiment was the
guest of the Jockey Club at the Loudon Park. It gave
an exhibition drill, and witnessed the races.</p>

<p>One of the features was a running race, open only to
the officers of the Third Division. It was participated in
by 20 officers, the leaders finishing in the following
order:&mdash;</p>

<p>Major Nickerson, Seventh United States Cavalry; Lieutenant
Hero, Fourth United States Artillery; Lieutenant-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Bailey; Colonel Pew; Major Eldredge; Adjutant
Barroll, and Quartermaster Wonson, all of the Eighth
Massachusetts; Lieutenant Horton, Twelfth New York,
and Lieutenant Stinson, Eighth Massachusetts.</p>

<p>This contest was continued two other days, the "finals"
being run off Saturday, open to the entire camp (12,000),
any military horse, with an officer "up." The final was
won by Lieutenant-Colonel Bailey, Eighth Massachusetts,
on his mare "Alathea," with Adjutant Barroll, Eighth
Massachusetts, second, on Colonel Pew's "Essex."</p>

<p>Ladies were frequently the guests of the regiment, and
especially on review days. Two large reviews were held
in which all the troops participated, one in honor of General
Russell A. Alger, Secretary of War, and the other in
honor of Governor Bradley of Kentucky. On September
20th, General Russell A. Alger arrived by rail, and was
met at the station by the Second Brigade, and escorted to
General Breckenridge's headquarters. Later on, a review
was tendered by the Division. The Eighth paraded over
eight hundred men, and from this time its numbers were
continually increasing by the return of convalescents to
duty, and the expiration of furloughs.</p>

<p>After the review, the Secretary of War inspected the
Division Hospital and the various camps. He spent some
time in the camp of the Eighth, chatting with the officers,
and took occasion to compliment the regiment upon its
intelligent struggle against typhoid at Chickamauga.</p>

<p>Early in August, the Secretary of War had sent Colonel
Hopkins, Assistant Inspector General of the United States
Army, to examine and report upon the condition of the
troops at Chickamauga. Colonel Hopkins' report to the
Secretary of War was subsequently published, but was unknown
to the regiment at this time. In it he said that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Eighth Massachusetts was the only regiment in the Park he
was sure had complied with sanitary regulations, and that
its low sick rate, as compared with that of other regiments,
showed an intelligent appreciation of the situation
by the officers, and an earnest effort to stop the
spread of preventable disease, by the application of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'hygenic measures'">hygienic
measures</ins>.</p>

<p>Later in the day, the Generals and Colonels of the
Division met the Secretary at General Breckenridge's
headquarters, and were invited to express their opinion on
the sanitary conditions. Some of the officers bitterly
denounced the inefficiency of the Quartermaster's Department
and the Medical Department at Chickamauga; the
Chief Surgeon of the corps was characterized as a horse
doctor, and his professional qualifications were criticised.</p>

<p>Several changes of officers were made in October. On
the 20th, General Breckenridge turned over the command
of the Corps to General James H. Wilson, under whom the
Eighth served until mustered out.</p>

<p>On the 7th, Rev. George D. Sanders, the Chaplain, resigned.
The Rev. Milo H. Gates of Ipswich, was appointed
to fill this vacancy November 11th, but before
being mustered in, was thrown from a horse, and owing to
his injuries was unable to pass the physical examination.
Chaplain Sanders was subsequently re-appointed and
joined the regiment in Cuba.</p>

<p>On October 24th, Lieutenant Francis H. Downey of
Company I, died at the St. Joseph's Hospital in Lexington,
of pneumonia. Funeral services were held over his
remains in the city, and were attended by the officers of
the regiment, and by Companies D and I. He was the
only officer in the command who died during the service.</p>

<p>On the 28th, Lieutenant-Colonel Edwin W. M. Bailey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
resigned, and Major William Stopford was promoted to
Lieutenant-Colonel. The vacancy in majority was not
filled, as the United States allowed at this time but two
majors to a regiment. Colonel Stopford continued to
command the First Battalion. Owing to the place of his
promotion, he became known in Lexington society as the
real Kentucky Colonel.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Stephen N. Bond of Company K, resigned
on October 28th.</p>

<p>During the temporary absence of the regimental surgeon,
Captain Rutherford of the Second Missouri, was
assigned and remained on duty with the regiment several
weeks.</p>

<p>After the Third Division had recovered its health, the
proposition to make a practice march was again discussed.
Lieutenant Francisco A. DeSousa of Company E, with a
detail from the regiment, was sent over the road to Frankford,
Kentucky, to locate camps and select a suitable place
for rifle practice. It was the intention to have each regiment
march to Frankford and spend a week at target
practice. Owing to the lateness of the season and the approach
of cold weather, the undertaking was abandoned.</p>

<p>On October 10th, General Waites, who was about to
retire from the command of the Second Brigade, tendered
the officers a reception at his quarters. Soon after the
officers of the Eighth had returned to their camp, Colonel
Pew received directions through a staff officer to issue ball
ammunition, and hold his men in readiness to march. The
order was immediately obeyed. No explanation was
offered, and the regiment awaited developments.</p>

<p>In the quiet night the measured beat of marching was
heard along the Bryan Pike, and the Regimental Guard
reported the One Hundred and Sixtieth Indiana going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
into Lexington to quell a riot. A member of the Third
Kentucky on provost duty in the city, had shot and killed
a soldier of the Twelfth New York, who refused to halt
when ordered. The sentinel was arrested pending an inquiry.</p>

<p>A rumor spread through the camp that a number of the
Twelfth New York and the First Territorial Regiments
had started for the city to lynch this sentinel. There was
more or less disturbance at the Montrose station by a mob
of excited soldiers, and several shots were fired.</p>

<p>The Eighth was ordered to deploy one battalion as
skirmishers across the Bryan Pike, and railroad track, and
stop all soldiers. The other two battalions were to remain
under arms in camp as a reserve. Colonel Stopford executed
this deployment with the First Battalion. Nothing
happened, and he was withdrawn before morning. The
situation in the city was easily controlled by the provost
guard with the help of the One Hundred and Sixtieth
Indiana.</p>

<p>In October Governor Wolcott directed General Robert
A. Blood, the Surgeon General of Massachusetts, to visit
the camps of the Eighth and Fifth Massachusetts regiments
and report on the sanitary condition, rations and
hospital accommodations of these regiments. As a result
of this trip, General Blood made the following report to
the Governor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"After three or four days at Camp Meade, visiting the
Fifth Regiment, I proceeded to Camp Hamilton, Lexington,
Kentucky, where I arrived in due time. I found the
camp of the Eighth Regiment about four or five miles out
from Lexington, and in the heart of the blue-grass country.
This was a most delightful situation, and I think,
one of the finest locations for a camp I have ever seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>I was cordially received by Colonel Pew, commander
of the Eighth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, and
every opportunity was given me by the Colonel to inspect
this camp. This regiment was stationed at Camp Thomas
for a long time. There had been a great deal of sickness,
mostly typhoid fever, but at the time of my visit there
were no new cases, and the cases in the hospitals were progressing
favorably. At this time there were no regimental
hospitals. Orders for re-establishing the regimental
hospitals had just been received from headquarters, but
no medicines or medical supplies had been issued. I looked
the camp over very carefully, saw the men on duty and off
duty, and visited other camps for comparisons. I saw no
regiment at Camp Hamilton that seemed so thoroughly
up to all that goes to make a good regiment as the Eighth.
The men were soldierly in their bearing, the grounds were
kept in perfect condition, tents were all in order and
scrupulously clean. A great many of the men had fixed
up temporary bunks or cots for their beds. Altogether
this was perhaps the cleanest regiment, excepting the
Fifth Massachusetts, that I saw in all my visiting soldiers
in the field. It was certainly equal to any.</p>

<p>I saw almost nothing in the sanitary arrangements of
this regiment to criticise. The only thing, as with the
Fifth Regiment, which I think could be improved, is the
company cooking. Of course this will improve in time.
I stayed with this regiment nearly a week. I visited and
dined with General Breckenridge, commander of this post,
and with other general officers commanding divisions and
brigades. General Breckenridge was very kind to me,
showing me every attention, and all the officers I met at
Camp Hamilton treated me with the greatest consideration.
I take this opportunity to thank them. This army
corps was, I believe, under better discipline than any other
corps I saw during the summer, with the exception, possibly,
the regulars at Montauk.</p>

<p>I desire to say here, that, in my judgment, Colonel
Pew is a most excellent commander, and all the officers of
the Eighth whom I met seemed to be well up in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
profession and doing most excellent work. The regiment
as I saw it was an honor to the State."</p></div>

<p>By the end of October the nights had become chilly, and
although bed sacks and extra blankets were issued to the
men, it was difficult to keep warm. Americus, Georgia,
had been designated in orders as the future home of the
Eighth Massachusetts and Twelfth New York and a detail
from the Eighth was already upon the ground preparing
a camp site.</p>

<p>Orders were issued for the Eighth to entrain on November
10th for Americus, and upon this date the regiment
was transferred to the Second Brigade, Second Division,
First Army Corps. The regiment had been ordered to
entrain early in the morning near the Montrose station,
but owing to the delay in loading the baggage of Brigade
Headquarters, it was impossible for the Quartermaster
of the Eighth to begin loading his baggage before afternoon.</p>

<p>The regiment had risen early, and had its breakfast
before 5 o'clock, and in compliance with orders, all baggage
had been packed and transported to the station. The
day was cold and raw, and a steady downpour of rain had
converted the camp site into a mass of mud. Tents had
been struck and shipped to the station, and the men were
required to remain on the camp ground all day without
food or shelter, waiting for the passenger sections to pull
in from Lexington.</p>

<p>Many of the men in their efforts to keep warm, drank
too much whiskey, and a large number in the regiment became
sadly demoralized. The guard house, a wooden
structure, was set on fire, and some of the prisoners had
a narrow escape from cremation. The event was known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
as the evacuation of Lexington. The troop trains did not
arrive until after dark, when the regiment embarked, and
for the first time since five in the morning, the men were
served with food and hot coffee. The departure from Lexington
was sad and dispiriting and was made under trying
conditions.</p>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i119.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">When the regiments of the Second Division
were moved from Lexington, they were assigned
to camps in southwestern Georgia, in
the cities of Macon, Columbus, Americus and
Albany. The Eighth <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Massachusettts and the Twelfth'">Massachusetts and the Twelfth</ins> New
York went to Americus, where three regimental camp
sites had been prepared, and orders were issued for the
Eighth United States Infantry to join the brigade. This
order was countermanded, and no other regiments went to
Americus.</p>

<p>On the morning of November 12th, the four sections
bearing the Eighth Massachusetts and its impedimenta
reached Americus. The two camp sites were about a mile
from the city, and separated by the highway. The Eighth
was assigned to a large sodded field, where substantial
wooden company sinks had been constructed, water pipes
laid to each company kitchen, and an electric street lighting
system was being installed.</p>

<p>For a week the men of the Eighth were as industrious
as ants. Each company erected a long shed at the foot of
the company street, one end of which was closed in for a
kitchen, in which was assembled every convenience for
preparing food. The rest of the shed was used as a mess
house, and furnished with long deal tables and benches,
where the men could sit and enjoy their meals. Canvas
awnings were attached to the long sides of the mess hall,
to be used as a protection against rain and wind.</p>

<p>Deep pits were dug for kitchen sinks. These were
covered with tree trunks and the dirt replaced and carefully
arranged in a mound. A detachable hopper was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
placed in the top of each mound to drain liquid wastes
into the sinks; the solids were than collected in closed iron
cans, and were carted twice daily to a crematory. The
hoppers were enclosed in wooden boxes with covers, which
were always resplendent with a fresh coat of whitewash.</p>

<p>Long wash stands were constructed with an overflow
trough into the kitchen sinks. A pipe ran the length of
these stands, with frequent faucets and iron wash basins.
Each company was supplied with a bathing tent in which
a shower bath was constructed, where the men could bathe
every day if they so desired, and were required to bathe
twice a week. Tent floors were provided, and lumber for
bunks and clothing racks. A system of drainage was installed,
and each company street ditched and crowned to
the center.</p>

<p>Battalion water plants were constructed, where all the
water supplied to the regiment for drinking purposes was
boiled, filtered and iced.</p>

<p>The means for caring for the sick were excellent. In
addition to a regimental hospital, used as a dispensary,
but supplied with quarters sufficient to care for a number
of men, there was a brigade hospital located in a dwelling
house, and adjacent to this were erected a number of hospital
tents with double boarded floors, and with sides also
boarded, so that patients were as comfortable in the mild
climate of Georgia as if they had been in the best managed
institution of the kind in Boston. The Brigade Hospital
was in charge of Major William Cogswell.</p>

<p>A building was erected for a post exchange, which was
successfully operated by a council of officers consisting of
Captains Alexander G. Perkins of Company A, William
C. Dow of Company F, and Edward J. Horton of Company
G. All necessaries that were needed by the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
were offered for sale here at reasonable rates, and its restaurant
became famous for egg sandwiches and oyster
stews. All these paraphernalia of comfort and health
were daily inspected by company commanders, battalion
commanders, regimental commander, and the brigade commander.</p>

<p>Just before Thanksgiving, Colonel Arnold A. Rand of
Boston, visited the camp and reported its condition to
Governor Wolcott. He said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"I think you would be glad to know that the regiment is
in most excellent condition; the officers cheery, trim, and a
credit to the State. I did not see the regiment on parade,
but which was very much better, I saw quite thoroughly
the quarters, and examined everything as to the sanitary
condition, from the sinks to the corral. I also saw the men
at mess, and the quality of the rations. The whole regiment
seemed in excellent condition, and is such a credit to
the state that it is a very great pleasure to make such a
report to you."</p></div>

<p>The men were allowed much liberty between drills, and
passes were issued to visit the city during the day. Many
side trips were made to Andersonville to visit the site of
the celebrated prison where many Federal soldiers were
confined during the Civil War. Order was preserved in
Americus by a provost guard, under command of Lieutenant
George H. Dow of Company A. This guard arrested
all soldiers found in the city without proper passes, and
returned them to the guard houses of their respective regiments
for <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'trial for absense'">trial for absence</ins> without leave.</p>

<p>The camp at Americus was at first named in honor of
Major Forse. The name was subsequently changed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Camp Gilman, as another camp had earlier received the
name of Camp Forse.</p>

<p>During the first few days at Americus, the Eighth was
greeted with many showers. The weather, however, was
so mild that the men did not wear overcoats except as a
protection against the rain. During the entire stay of the
Eighth, wildflowers and roses were in full bloom.</p>

<p>On one side of the camp an extensive cotton field waved
acres of bolls, breaking into white flowering balls, which
at a distance looked like a sea of white roses. It is said
that the low prices of cotton did not warrant picking this
field, and it was left intact and beautified the approach to
camp.</p>

<p>At no great distance were fields of sugar cane fit for harvesting,
where the men were often welcomed and treated
to a supply of chewing cane for the company. A solitary
peanut farm was discovered by some of the soldiers in
their peregrinations, and its product brought to camp.</p>

<p>The Georgia pines attracted much attention. Many of
these trees were transplanted and grouped about the camp
for landscape effect. Every line officer had one at his
front door.</p>

<p>All the officers constructed wooden porches in front of
their tents. The porch had two faces, in one of which
was a door, and in the other a glass window. The interior
space between the two faces was utilized for a Sibley
stove, and the pipe was carried through the wooden roof of
the porch. All these porches were whitewashed. A line
of officers' tents looked like a row of diminutive cottages,
and in the morning when every funnel was smoking, suggested
the busy preparation of breakfast in many little
homes.</p>

<p>The officers of the regiment, however, messed together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in a commodious building, which was divided into a dining
hall and kitchen. The dining hall was also used as a
regimental school room, and as a place for social meeting
in the evening.</p>

<p>On one occasion a birthday dinner was given in this
hall at which a historic cake figured. A lady sent this
cake with an appropriate number of candles to one of the
officers, and by way of a joke, wrote a letter to the
Secretary of War, pretending to be the officer's sister, and
asked to have the regiment held at Americus until her
brother got his cake. This letter was preserved by Secretary
Alger as a bonafide communication, and was later
commented upon in his history of the War with Spain as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"Of all the requests however received, perhaps the most
unique was that which came from a young lady in Boston.
Her note paper, hand writing, and rhetoric vouched at
least for the culture of the writer. Her request was simple
and plainly worded. With much unfeigned earnestness
she stated her case. The press despatches had announced
that the volunteer regiment of which her brother was a
member, was to leave for Cuba at a fixed date, but the
brother's birthday came two days before the date assigned
for his embarkation. A birthday box of cake, jellies, pies,
etc., she said, had been forwarded to him, and would not
be received if the regiment left on the date announced.
She naively asked that the regiment be detained until the
sweetmeats arrived, as she was sure it would make no
difference to the Government, whereas, it would be such a
disappointment to her brother."</p></div>

<p>During the first few weeks at Americus, the camp was
overrun with colored people. They came from far and
near to see the soldiers. Many of them carried covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
baskets, and it was not long before a well-founded suspicion
grew, that many of these baskets came into camp empty,
and went out filled with plunder. The Eighth soon had a
little race problem of its own to solve. In each company
a squad of strong men assumed the duty of elevating the
colored race.</p>

<p>The process of elevation consisted in capturing every
colored man with a covered basket, and tossing him on a
blanket into the air, until the arms of the soldiers got
tired, and they could keep it up no longer. The sight of
a negro with a basket was the signal for a rush in his
direction with a blanket, and he was soon traveling skyward,
in spite of every objection on his part to such
treatment. For a few days, every such colored visitor was
received in the open arms of a regulation blanket.</p>

<p>As objectionable visitors became scarce, and covered
baskets disappeared, this moral propaganda ceased, and as
far as the Eighth was concerned, the race problem was
solved.</p>

<p>Major Edward H. Eldredge was detailed by General
Waites to select a rifle range for the entire brigade. He
selected one about half a mile from the camp, where targets
were installed under his direction at 200 and 500 yards.
It was reported that the regiment was to be armed with the
Krag-Jorgensen rifles before the command was sent to
Cuba, and it was the intention to have the soldiers spend a
portion of each day at the range.</p>

<p>On November 20th, General Sanger arrived to relieve
General Waites of the command of the Second Brigade.
Under General Sanger, active preparations were at once
begun for Cuba. Medical inspections were instituted to
weed out officers and men unfit for foreign service. The
regiment received a consignment of Krag-Jorgensen rifles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and its supplies generally were overhauled and replenished.
General Sanger made a thorough inspection of the
regiment by battalions. This inspection lasted three days.
Permission was obtained from the Adjutant-General of the
Army to recruit the regiment to full strength, by transferring
men from regiments in Massachusetts not yet mustered
out. A number of men who served in Porto Rico
with the Sixth Massachusetts, and were at home waiting
muster out, were transferred to the Eighth under this permission,
and joined the regiment in December and
January.</p>

<p>On December 9th, General Wilson, the Corps Commander,
and General Ludlow, the Division Commander,
visited Americus to inspect the brigade. Owing to a severe
storm, the review of the troops was omitted; but the camp
was thoroughly inspected by the Generals.</p>

<p>At the hospital of the Eighth, General Wilson said to the
officer in charge:&mdash;"Surgeon, this is a model hospital, because
it has no patients." The health of the regiment had
steadily improved since the end of the first month at
Lexington, and on the morning of this inspection there
were just 1000 men present for duty with the colors. On
December 27th, for the first time in seven months, there
was not a single soldier of the Eighth in either the Regimental,
Brigade, or Division Hospital.</p>

<p>On December 12th the mess-house of Company L
burned. A kettle of fat boiled into the fire, and the flames
quickly caught the roof of the kitchen and spread, exploding
a can of kerosene. The building was soon wrapped in
a sheet of flames. The regiment turned out and saved the
adjoining buildings, but the mess house, with all the company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>supplies, was a total loss. The men of L were
assigned to other companies for rations, until a new dining
hall and kitchen were constructed.</p>

<p>About this time, Company L met with another loss, in
the death of its mascot. The company had appropriated
a young razor-back at Chickamauga, which, becoming attached
to the company, followed it from camp to camp.
He lived in the company street and was as familiar with
the men as a well-trained dog. By Thanksgiving, the pig
had grown to such proportions that he was ordered by
higher authority, turned over to a butcher and served to
the company as rations.</p>

<p>Company F had a lady goat as a mascot. She went
through the service with the company, and was finally
mustered out in Haverhill, where her descendents are
numerous. The goat would follow the drum corps anywhere
as long as it was marching away from camp,
but immediately the direction was taken towards camp,
the goat became obdurate and had to be pulled home.</p>

<p>Just before Thanksgiving, the Colonel received the following
telegram from Captain Augustus P. Gardner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"Should be glad to pay cost of best Thanksgiving dinner
for your regiment. If you approve, wire answer."</p></div>

<p>The proper answer was promptly wired, and the regimental
commissary was sent into market to purchase
turkeys and all that goes to make up a best Thanksgiving
dinner. A similar dinner was furnished to the regiment
at Christmas time by Hon. George von L. Meyer. These
feasts were much appreciated by the men and were enjoyed
amidst much merry making.</p>

<p>About this time several changes occurred among the
commissioned officers, Captain Frank B. Denning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Lieutenant Linville H. Wardwell of Company C leaving
the service by resignation. Second Lieutenants F. A.
DeSousa of Company E and David F. Jewell of Company
F were promoted to first lieutenants. The former was
assigned to Company I and the latter to Company K.</p>

<p>At the same time First Sergeant Loran J. Harvey of
Company I, and Sergeant Alexander Robertson of Company
E were commissioned as second lieutenants, after
a competitive examination. The former was attached to
Company E and the latter to Company F.</p>

<p>On December 22nd the weather bureau, predicting a
great storm, sent a telegram of warning to all the military
camps. The telegram to the Eighth stated that the thermometer
would drop 30 degrees. Not knowing just what
to do with this information, the Colonel directed it to be
published at evening parade. At evening parade, the
orders of the day were read by the Adjutant, and on this
occasion the telegram was read as the last part of the daily
order; then followed the usual phraseology,&mdash;"By order of
Colonel Pew." The reading of this telegram at the end of
an order, caused considerable amusement in camp, at the
idea that Colonel Pew would order the thermometer to
drop 30 degrees.</p>

<p>A flag pole was furnished the regiment and erected near
the center of the camp. On December 28th a garrison flag
was received and broken out from this pole with appropriate
ceremonies. Thereafter, at reveille and retreat it was
hoisted and lowered. The flag and pole were carried to and
used in Cuba. On being mustered out, the flag was presented
to the regiment, and is now preserved at regimental
headquarters.</p>

<p>During this stay at Americus, Major Frank A. Graves
and Captain Charles T. Hilliker of Company D were ab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>sent
from the regiment most of the time on court martial
duty at Columbus.</p>

<p>A common diversion in southern Georgia is cock fighting.
Many mains were attended by members of the regiment.
A number of officers were presented with railroad
passes, and invited to go to Savannah to see a review of
part of the Seventh Corps, previous to its embarkation for
Havana. Permission was obtained for about 20 officers
to make this trip. The train left Americus at midnight,
but through some misunderstanding, the officers assembled
at the hotel about 7 o'clock, and had an evening upon their
hands.</p>

<p>One of the officers, thinking cock fighting was not tabooed
by law, and having been told by a prominent citizen
that a main could be arranged on short notice at any time,
called up the citizen by telephone in the hotel lobby, and
invited him to bring the cocks to the hotel and begin at
once. He was promptly suppressed by the hotel proprietor,
and the law explained to him. A quiet, gentlemanly
main was tolerated, but not a public and bold defiance
of the law.</p>

<p>A quiet, gentlemanly main was accordingly arranged
for in a large upper room, occupied by the grand jury as
sleeping apartments, while they were supposed to be engaged
in an all-night session at the Court House. Various
mysterious bundles were smuggled into these quarters by
darkies, the windows were darkened, cocks were heeled,
and fighting was soon in progress. After several fights
had been pulled off, word came that the grand jury was
about to leave the Court House, and retire for the night.
There was a wild scramble to put the place in order, and a
hurried exit of cocks and darkies. The officers brought up
the rear of this retreat, and wished the grand jury a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
pleasant night's rest as they passed them in the hotel
corridors.</p>

<p>About the middle of December, General Ludlow, who
commanded the Division, was ordered to Havana as a
military governor. His place was taken by General
Sanger, and the command at Americus devolved upon
Colonel Pew.</p>

<p>Conical tents were issued in sufficient quantity to equip
half the command. This was the regiment's first experience
with khaki canvas. Company commanders were
loath to substitute them for the wall tents which they had
been using. Accordingly each company was required to
erect these tents on one side of the company street. After
the first night, almost every company commander informed
headquarters that he had no objections to having his whole
command in conical tents. It did not take the men long to
discover the advantages of khaki canvas, and that they
could burn a light behind it after taps, with no fear of
detection. Conical tents at once became popular in all the
companies.</p>

<p>On December 23rd, the Twelfth New York received
orders to proceed to Charleston and embark with General
Sanger for Matanzas. Major Eldredge was detached from
the regiment to accompany General Sanger as a member
of his staff. The command of the Third Battalion was
assumed by Captain William C. Dow, of Company F.
The New York regiment left Americus the day after
Christmas. Fifty-four men and one officer remained behind
as unfit for foreign service, and were temporarily
attached to the Eighth until they could be mustered out.</p>

<p>On December 30th, the Eighth received orders to prepare
for Cuba. They reported 40 officers, 1112 men, 29<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
wagons, 119 mules, 26 horses, and 26 civilian employees,
with all necessary supplies ready to move at once.</p>

<p>At this time, when the regiment was anxious to move,
and congratulating itself on the absence of all sickness,
measles broke out. The matter was kept quiet, and every
company was inspected by the surgeons twice daily, to
detect and isolate suspected cases. The surgeons thought
the spread of the disease could be stopped if everything in
camp was boiled.</p>

<p>The last day of the year was as mild and pleasant as a
summer day in the North. Early in the morning, active
preparations began for boiling. Everything that could
hold and boil water, was called into service. Caldrons,
pots, pans, and kettles, were soon steaming all over the
camp. Visitors were excluded for the day, and by noon
time the whole regiment had committed its belongings to
boiling water.</p>

<p>A naked drum corps furnished music for a couple of
hours, and the men danced about like a mob of naked savages.
At a distance, passing natives gathered on the highway
and wondered what it was all about. The colored
people were willing to believe that the evil one was at the
bottom of it all. After the regiment had boiled itself free
from germs, the guard was relieved, and went through the
same process.</p>

<p>Everything in the regiment which could stand boiling,
was boiled, and everything which could not stand a soaking
was otherwise disinfected. Measles were thoroughly
stamped out, and at the end of a week when the regiment
left for Cuba, but five men remained behind for this reason.</p>

<p>On January 4th a large delegation of citizens visited
camp to say good-bye. After evening parade Colonel Lane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
in behalf of the City of Americus, addressed the regiment.
He spoke in laudatory terms concerning the conduct of the
soldiers, and how the presence of Massachusetts troops in
Georgia had created new bonds of sympathy between
North and South.</p>

<p>Colonel Lane had requisitioned a wagon as a convenient
platform from which to address the soldiers. Many citizens
had come in carriages, and these carriages were
wedged in about the orator, facing the regiment. At the
conclusion of Colonel Lane's remarks, Drum Major
Thomas, catching the enthusiasm of the moment, caused
the drum corps to break into "Dixie" under the very
noses of several hundred horses. Horses turned short in
their shafts, and stampeded to the rear, the orator's platform
slid from under him, and it was some time before
the ceremonies of leave taking could be resumed with
proper decorum.</p>

<p>The next evening the regiment returned the courtesy
of this call by marching into town and holding an evening
parade in the public square. On the return to camp, it
found that Harry E. Stiles, its bandmaster in the
Militia service, had reported for duty, to organize a band
and accompany the regiment to Cuba.</p>

<p>More changes among the commissioned officers occurred
during this month. Lieutenant Eugene Larrivee of Company
L resigned. Chaplain George D. Sanders, who had
resigned, was re-commissioned and rejoined the regiment.
Lieutenant John M. Pettengill of Company B was promoted
to captain and assigned to Company C. Second
Lieutenants Frank Stinson of Company B and Frederic
P. Smith of Company C were each made first lieutenants
in their companies.</p>

<p>First Sergeant Edgar J. Whelpley of Company H,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
First Sergeant James W. Jackman of Company K, Sergeant
Charles R. Warner of Company I and Sergeant
William H. Clendennin of Company M were commissioned
second lieutenants. Lieutenant Whelpley went to
Company C, Lieutenant Jackman to Company B, Lieutenant
Warner to Company G and Lieutenant Clendennin
to Company L.</p>

<p>On January 6th the First Battalion under command of
Lieutenant Colonel Stopford, entrained for Savannah,
where it embarked on board the transport Obdam. It
broke camp during a rain storm on the coldest day the regiment
had experienced in Georgia.</p>

<p>As soon as the Twelfth New York left, Colonel Pew began
to collect a supply of lumber for use in Cuba. The
buildings which this regiment had occupied were pulled
down, and every board washed with a solution of corrosive
sublimate. Two cars were obtained and loaded to accompany
the regiment.</p>

<p>On the evening of January 8th the Second and Third
Battalions and Headquarters entrained for Savannah. The
most of January 9th was spent in being shifted about in
the freight yards at Savannah. A casual visitor to one of
the sections told the officers that the ground in the yard
where they were was so saturated with pine pitch, that a
lighted match dropped would start a conflagration. One of
the officers, thinking to call this bluff, made an experiment.
The visitor had told the truth, and the regiment had a conflagration
on its hands. The flames licked up the ground
as if it had been saturated with kerosene. The soldiers
were powerless to stop the fire with the means at their
disposal. The railroad fire department appeared with
chemical tanks, and soon had it under control, before any
damage had been done, except blistering a few cars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>In Savannah the Colonel received a letter from Major
Eldredge, telling him the character of the camp site the
regiment was to occupy at Matanzas. The Major suggested
the men would have to use iron tent pins and do some
blasting to make their Cuban home comfortable. The
Depot Quartermaster at Savannah was called upon and
furnished a supply of drills, sledge hammers, powder and
iron rods. The soldiers spent most of the night in the
cars, while details were loading supplies onto the transport.
At 3 o'clock on the morning of January 10th, the
men began to embark, and at daylight the transport Michigan
had cast off, and was slowly steaming down the river.
At last the regiment was off for Cuba.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">On January 10th the Obdam bearing the First
Battalion of the Eighth, came to anchor at
Matanzas, in a wide, shallow bay, where ships
lie a mile or more off shore to discharge. Hills
topped with palms, rose on either side of the city, which
spread out on a strip of land between two little rivers,
and straggled up the slopes, until the stone houses of the
town proper gave place to palm thatched huts on the outskirts.
The city upon a close inspection, was dirty and
battered, but from the sea its pink and blue walls presented
a picturesque appearance.</p>

<p>General Wilson, the Military Governor, and his staff,
immediately landed, and were received by the Twelfth
New York. The men of the Eighth witnessed this function
from a distance. They were kept on the transport
during the day, while their baggage was landed.</p>

<p>The military camps were located on the western shore
of the bay, where the northeast trades blow continually
across the bay from the open ocean, always insuring pure
air. It was a scant mile from the city, and pipes from
the municipal water service were laid, insuring a bountiful
supply of water.</p>

<p>The camp of the Eighth lay behind the old Spanish
Fort San Severino, and between the camp of the engineer
battalion, and the Twelfth New York. A broad boulevard
in a bad state of repair extended from the old fort to the
town. All the troops were encamped along this boulevard,
on ground that for rockiness and general hardness of appearance,
outclassed any perpendicular farm in New England.</p>

<p>The rocks were of coral and volcanic origin, thrown up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
ages ago, and appeared above the surface in many fantastic
shapes. Every square yard had its share of rock jutting
above the red soil in sharp pinnacles. The ground had
been covered with brush and cactus, but the engineers had
been at work during the week prior to the arrival of the
Obdam, clearing this away, so that when the First Battalion
landed, it found the ground cleared of all vegetation.</p>

<p>The landing was made at a small wharf near the fort,
and a few steps across the dilapidated boulevard, brought
the men to their future home. The regiment had an
excellent site, the bay lay before it, and the ground
rose in terraces from the water until it terminated in a
range of hills a mile back of the camp.</p>

<p>Major Eldredge who had preceded the regiment as a
member of General Sanger's staff, received the public
property turned over to the United States by Spain, in
accordance with the evacuation agreement, in Matanzas,
and later in the City of Cardenas and other towns in the
province. When the regiment arrived, he was busily engaged
at Matanzas in establishing charities, and in reorganizing
the police department. The country about the
city, as in other parts of Cuba, was a waste, and the people
were in a destitute condition. It was the first duty of the
United States to care for the people, and supply them
with food.</p>

<p>While the First Battalion was locating itself at Matanzas,
the Second and Third Battalions were enjoying a delightful
voyage. During the whole trip the sea was calm,
and the Michigan glided along as smoothly as any pleasure
yacht upon a summer cruise. Very few men complained
of sea sickness, and soon got over any unpleasant
feeling, and enjoyed the trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>It was warm and stuffy where they were quartered in
the hold, but their discomfort vanished with daylight,
when they climbed on deck to loll in the shade and enjoy
the steady northeast trade. The Michigan was formerly
a freight vessel of the Warren Line, used as a cattle boat
to carry live stock to England.</p>

<p>The enlisted men were <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'assigend quarters'">assigned quarters</ins> between decks.
There were no berths, but each man was furnished with
a duck hammock, which at night was hung on hooks
in wooden uprights. These hammocks were hung in tiers,
one over the other. In the morning the hammocks were
rolled and stored, and the quarters prepared for inspection,
which took place twice daily, at 10 A. M., and just
before retreat. These inspections were made by the
Colonel, accompanied by the transport quartermaster, the
police officer, medical officer, and master of the ship. After
the morning inspection, daily exercise was required on
deck.</p>

<p>Sometime during the day every man had a bath. They
stripped on the forward deck, and were pumped upon
with a stream of water from the ocean.</p>

<p>The officers quarters were as cramped as those of the
men. There were only ten state rooms. The ships guard
consisted of one company detailed for each day, the captain
acting as officer of the day, and the lieutenants as
officers of the guard. Each company commander provided
his command with proper police utensils from the ships
quartermaster, and looked after the policing of the company
quarters. Cooking was done in the ship's galleys.
During the trip, Stiles commenced work with the musicians
on board, for the new regimental band. This
nucleus had band practice every day.</p>

<p>During the second day the transport steamed along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Florida coast within sight of a continuous stretch of beach
sand and palm groves. At Jupiter Inlet a salute was exchanged
with some guns mounted near the summer hotels,
and the ship went so near the shore that the winter visitors
could be counted on the hotel piazzas.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of the 12th, the first glimpse was
caught of Cuba. During the night the transport lay off
shore waiting for a pilot. On the morning of the 13th, a
pilot came on board and the vessel steamed into the Bay
of Matanzas, and came to anchor about two miles from
the city. A guard detail was immediately placed upon
the small wharf near San Severino to guard the baggage
as it was landed. Details were made to clear up the ship
and assist in discharging baggage and live stock.</p>

<p>As soon as the sentries were posted on the wharf, the
soldiers began to be lightered to the shore. A corral was
established near the wharf, where the horses and mules
were soon assembled. Before night the men on the Michigan
were landed, and had joined their comrades of the
First Battalion in a pup camp, between the Boulevard
and the water, under the walls of San Severino.</p>

<p>For a week the soldiers of the Eighth were busy preparing
their new camp. Large hospital tents were issued
to the command. Each company was divided into squads
of six men under a corporal, and assigned to a tent. These
tents were large enough to accommodate ten men, and in
them seven men had all the room they required. A large
fly was issued with each tent. As it was impossible
to drive tent pins, large joists were used in the framing of
the tent floors, and portions of these joists were extended
on either side, to which the guy ropes were attached. The
tent floors were laid about a foot above the surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
ground on posts. To every man there was issued a Gold
Medal cot.</p>

<p>Each company, with the lumber brought from Americus,
erected a frame mess house with substantial flooring,
and constructed mess tables and seats. The roofs of these
mess houses were covered with canvas, and in the rear of
each a kitchen was built. The quarters of the battalion
commanders were upon a terrace slightly raised above the
level of the line officers street. Behind this terrace was another,
the center of which was occupied by Regimental
headquarters. On one side of this terrace, a Regimental
hospital was established, and on the other end, a stable
with a canvas roof for the horses and mules.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty was experienced in constructing
roads through this camp. The rocks cropped out in points,
which had to be broken with sledge hammers, or blasted
with powder. Major Graves performed the important
duties of superintendent of streets, and soon had a beautiful
macadamized road running the whole length of the
camp in front of the line officers quarters.</p>

<p>From the center of this road, a well constructed way
led to the field officers terrace, and to the corral on the
headquarters terrace. Each company street was also
macadamized. The rough pointed stones which had been
broken off were laid as a foundation and gravel and sand
were brought in as a covering. These roads were crowned
in the center, and were a most creditable production, and
the source of much favorable comment and praise. Major
Graves was often congratulated upon the work of his new
department.</p>

<p>The gray walls of San Severino early attracted the
attention of the soldiers. It was an old Spanish fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
erected to defend the approach to Matanzas, and had just
been evacuated by Spanish troops.</p>

<p>The Cuban visitors to camp who could make themselves
understood, spread harrowing tales of death recently inflicted
upon insurgents within its gloomy masonry. The
old fort had been standing for centuries, and looked to the
imagination like a suitable home for any kind of horror
or torture. The tales told were to the effect that insurgents
were often lined up in squads against the walls and
shot to death, or decapitated and their bodies thrown into
the bay. A special wall in the counterscarp was pointed
out as the execution place.</p>

<p>The American soldiers, ever on the outlook for souvenirs,
succeeded in probing many battered bullets from the
coral masonry of this wall, which were sent home as
evidence of these tales. The fort was soon occupied and
used as a military prison.</p>

<p>Lieutenant James H. Craig of Company L was detailed
as its first commander, and under him the casements were
made habitable for its guards, and for the prisoners awaiting
general court martial or serving sentences. An old
piece of Spanish ordnance was mounted on the parapet
and did duty for a sunrise and sunset gun.</p>

<p>This picturesque pile was always in the foreground of
any outlook from the camp of the Eighth, and under its
shade the men loafed, or took they daily dip in the waters
of the bay. All shipping passed the fort or lay at anchor
under its guns. In the morning or at night the water in
front of it was alive with birds and pelicans, diving for
food, with great fish bags hanging from their lower jaws,
and in the lazy afternoons, these same birds were seen
perched on pieces of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'floatsam taking'">flotsam taking</ins> siestas.</p>

<p>A few miles across the bay the walls of a settlement said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to be occupied by Cuban insurgents, broke with a broad
band of glittering white between the bright blue of the
water, and the green expanse of grass and palms, which
on rolling hills, rose to meet the blue sky on a distant
horizon. The steady trade wind, beginning about eight
in the morning, and dying away just before sunset, rendered
life in the shade of the fort pleasant and comfortable,
however high the thermometer mounted in the sun.</p>

<p>As soon as the camp was put in condition, military
work outside of guard and provost duty was usually performed
in the early morning or late afternoon. During
the middle of the day officers and men had leisure to enjoy
the pleasure of just living and being in the tropics.</p>

<p>Much of the hard work in unloading transports and
getting the camp sites ready for occupation was done by
Cubans in the employ of the government. Some two hundred
of these worked about the camps in squads, under the
charge of non-commissioned officers from the engineer
battalion. A large number were employed in cleaning up
the city, and putting it in a sanitary condition. Much
work was undertaken by the government to furnish
employment to the poor.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel William Stopford was appointed
general police officer for all the camps, and had quite a
force of civilian employees under him. In his sanitary
work he was charged with the duty of destroying the many
reconcentrado huts that had been constructed on the outskirts
of the town. The sides of these huts were made of
dried palm bark, and the roofs were thatched with palm
leaves. They had been built by the poor country people
compelled to come within the lines of concentration by the
Spanish soldiery. Their owners were usually glad to take
the fifteen dollars offered by the government and move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
out. The purchase and moving out process was completed
in a few minutes, and the evacuated homes set on fire.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of destitution throughout the
cities and towns of Matanzas Province. Most of the towns
had been occupied as fortified camps by the Spanish
troops, and the people of the surrounding country had
been brought within the limits of the camps to prevent
their helping the insurgents.</p>

<p>The food supply was inadequate to support the population
herded together in this way, and there were many
deaths from starvation, and great mortality, especially
among the children. Committees were formed throughout
the Province for the purpose of getting food to these
people. Captain Horace S. Bean of Company B was sent
into the interior to organize these committees and superintend
the distribution.</p>

<p>Chaplain George D. Sanders was detailed on special
duty as chairman of the commission on charities and corrections
for the District, where he served with much
credit until mustered out.</p>

<p>Many poor people came to the camp to collect scraps of
food that were thrown away. They were mostly children
and were not burdened with much covering. They were
special objects of pity to the soldiers, who supplied them
with food and clothing. After the depots were opened in
the city for the distribution of food, people were forbidden,
for sanitary reasons, assembling about the mess
houses.</p>

<p>The men were annoyed by other visitors for whom they
had no compassion. There was a large variety of bugs
and insects that made their homes among the coral rocks.
Centipedes and tarantulas were especially unwelcome, as
they formed the unpleasant habit of spending the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
in flannel shirt sleeves and trouser legs, and resented being
disturbed in the morning when the owner put on his clothing.
Fortunately, their bites, although very painful, were
not deadly. It was soon discovered that they disliked tent
floors which had been washed with a solution of corrosive
sublimate, and after a while these pests either died, or
migrated to other quarters, where they were treated to less
frequent doses of corrosive sublimate.</p>

<p>Everything in the City of Matanzas, including streets,
people, buildings and language, were at first matters of
great curiosity to the soldiers. The city was supposed to
have a population of some 40,000, and was the chief sea
port and capital of the province bearing the same name.
The streets were narrow and ill kept. The sidewalks were
not over two and a half feet wide, and most of the roadways
were so rough that it would be impossible to drive a
light American wagon over them without great discomfort.</p>

<p>The houses were mostly alike, built of stone or stucco,
and many were colored a light blue or pink. They were
built about a square court yard, and usually not over two
stories in height. The front of the houses were flush with
the sidewalks, and the windows barred on the outside. No
glass was used, but behind the iron bars, were shutters,
which, when opened, permitted anyone in the street to look
upon the family life within the front room. The front
door was usually large enough to allow a carriage to enter
the house, and opened into a passageway leading to a
court. The kitchen was in the corner of this court, or in a
covered way leading into a back court. This back court
was sometimes used as a stable, and the exit from the
stable was through the court and front door of the house.
Charcoal brasiers were used exclusively for cooking, and a
stove was unknown. The sleeping rooms were usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
upon the second floor, and opened upon a balcony, which
ran around three sides of the court. In the better class
of houses there was usually a fountain in the court, surrounded
by flowers and shrubbery.</p>

<p>Owing to the absence of decent roads, everything
brought from the country had to be carried upon pack
horses. The milk dealers carried their cans in the pouches
of a huge saddle placed upon a very small horse. Fodder
was carried through the streets on similar saddles, and a
horse bearing a load of grass, looked as if he was going to
a masquerade disguised as a hay cock. Venders peddled
bunches of poultry tied together by the legs, and fishermen
went about carrying blue lobsters hanging by their tails
from sticks, and advertised their wares in shrill invitations
to buy "langostas frescas."</p>

<p>Life in the streets and in the stores, the manner of preparing
and marketing foods, the different business methods,
and the Spanish language as a setting to all this strangeness,
was new and interesting. The men enjoyed the
custom of storekeepers charging different prices to officers
and enlisted men over the same counter for the same
article, and the bland way a haberdasher would meet an
officer's protest, by telling him that everything ought to
cost him more, as his pay was larger. On Sunday, the
only places of business closed were the U. S. Quartermaster
and Commissary Depots.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoons and evenings were holidays for everyone
except the storekeepers, and during Lent the streets
were filled with masqueraders. This <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'mannor of life'">manner of life</ins> was
new to the men from New England. Passes to visit the
city were freely issued, when not interfering with military
duty, and men with good records were allowed to visit
Havana for a few days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The City Hall in Matanzas, known as the Municipal
Palace, was situated on the Plaza in the middle of the
city. The Plaza was planted with palms and other tropical
trees, and was the center of business and social life.
In the evening, one of the military bands furnished music,
and the citizens promenaded or gathered about the tables
in the restaurants, whose many open doors made them a
continuation of the sidewalk. The buildings facing the
square were stately and picturesque, and in the evening
when the Plaza was thronged with merry groups, and the
electric lamps sparkled among trees and fountains, life
seemed very gay and foreign.</p>

<p>The provost guard was always on duty, and patrolled
the streets to maintain order. During the last of the stay
at Matanzas, Major Eldredge acted as Provost Marshal,
and Companies M, E, K, and H were detached from the
regiment as a permanent part of his guard, and were quartered
in the old Spanish barracks.</p>

<p>On January 20th, the Cubans began a celebration in
honor of independence. No restrictions were placed upon
these festivities, but troops were held in readiness to suppress
disorder. Many cruelties had been inflicted upon
the people of Matanzas by representatives of the Spanish
Government, and intense hatred was manifested against
the power that repressed them so long. As many Spaniards
remained in the city, it was feared, in the enthusiasm of
the celebration, some outburst of violence might occur
against them. General Betancourt, who commanded the
Cuban insurgents, assured General Wilson that his people
were too happy to commit any breach of the peace.</p>

<p>Orders were issued to the troops in camp that a single
gun fired from San Severino, was the signal to assemble,
and that any disturbance was to be at once suppressed. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the end of the boulevard, near its entrance to the city, a
marble statute of Alphonse XII, King of Spain, was
walled up in a brick casing to hide it, and preserve it as
a work of art against vandalism.</p>

<p>The celebration was held in a most peaceable and orderly
manner, and was a joyful expression of gratitude for deliverance
from oppression. Extensive preparations were
made by the people; public and private buildings were
decorated, and numerous arches spanned the streets, bearing
appropriate inscriptions in both Spanish and English.
One arch bore the inscription, "Hurrah for us." The
word "us" painted in small letters, referred to the United
States, and was evidently the way the author remembered
the marks on Government property. The American and
Cuban flags were waved together throughout the city.</p>

<p>The exercises commenced with a street parade of Cuban
troops, the fire department, school children and citizens.
The Eighth Drum Corps did duty at the head of the insurgent
soldiers. In the afternoon, vespers were held in
the Cathedral, and at night there was a display of fireworks
and general public rejoicing throughout the city.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the celebration took place the
next day opposite the camp of the Eighth, where a solemn
high mass of requiem was celebrated to the memory of
some sixty persons who had been garroted on the spot by
the public executioner. These were political prisoners
who had suffered in the death chair, by having their necks
broken while held in an iron collar, by a screw driven
against their spinal cord, and operated on the back of the
chair, very much as the screw of a letter press is worked.</p>

<p>An altar, covered with black velvet and decorated with
silver fringe, was erected on the site of these executions.
The priests and acolytes were dressed in black. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the services the Cuban soldiers rested on their arms, and
formed a military guard about the altar. The Eighth
Regiment and the Cuban Infantry Bands furnished music
for the mass. The relatives of the persons executed attended
in deep mourning, and added to the solemnity of
the services by their expressions of intense grief. The corner
stone of a monument to the memory of these patriots
was laid with Catholic ceremonies. A detail from the Engineer
Battalion prepared and lowered this stone in place
during the ceremonies.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the school children, dressed in American
and Cuban colors, led by the Eighth Regiment Drum
Corps, paraded and held a festival in the theatre. During
the evening there were numerous balls and fetes and
further exercises in the theatre. Twenty men from each
company were given passes and allowed to go into town.
On January 23rd the celebration concluded with a review
of all the troops, before the Municipal Palace, to show
that the American troops sympathized with the inhabitants
in their festivities.</p>

<p>On February 9th, a shot was fired by a member of the
Eighth Regiment in the discharge of his duty. It was
the stormiest night the regiment experienced in Cuba.
About midnight the sentinel in front of the Colonel's
quarters thought he saw two men coming from the hills
and creeping towards the tents. They refused to halt
when challenged. The sentinel rested his rifle over a corner
of the tent, with the muzzle a few inches above the
Colonel's ear and fired. The sentinel reported that one of
the men uttered an exclamation in good strong English,
and the two beat a hasty retreat. As an investigation disclosed
two goats in rear of the camp, it was generally supposed
that the sentinel attributed some general remarks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the Colonel about this occurrence, to one of the goats.</p>

<p>On February 11th all the troops at Matanzas were reviewed
by General Breckenridge, Inspector General of the
United States Army. The review took place upon the
boulevard, and was followed by a careful inspection of the
camps. This inspection was thus commented upon in his
official report to the War Department:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>"Matanzas Infantry Camp a model. ****** These
same soldiers had a perfect camp also at Lexington, Kentucky.
Such seasoned, well-instructed soldiers as the best
of these, like the Eighth Massachusetts, Twelfth New
York, and Third Engineers, and such handsome, healthful
camps, wrung from adverse nature are gratifying to
all whoever commanded them, and are to be expected from
such officers as Generals Wilson and Sanger."</p></div>

<p>On February 20th the Regiment assisted in the reception
of General Maximo Gomez, the Commander-in-Chief
of the Cuban Army. The men of the Eighth were
stationed about five paces apart on each side of the streets
leading from the Plaza to the railroad station. An escort
consisting of six troops of the Second United States Cavalry,
the fire department of the city, societies of citizens,
and the school children, all under the command of Colonel
Pew, met the General at the station, and conducted him
between the lines of the Eighth, to the Municipal Palace.
The streets were decorated with flags, and the citizens
turned out in holiday apparel. The General was received
with all the honors due his exalted station and standing in
the island. Enthusiasm was unbounded, and the Cuban
General appeared much moved by the ovation accorded
him along the entire route.</p>

<p>Flowers were showered upon him from the balconies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and flags were everywhere waved. The General was slight
in stature, appeared about seventy years of age, and was
mounted on a handsome Cuban charger.</p>

<p>As the procession passed, the members of the Eighth
fell in behind and brought up the rear in columns of fours.
At the Municipal Palace the General reviewed the troops
forming his escort. General Gomez remained in the city
a number of days, and upon leaving was escorted to the
railroad station by the Eighth.</p>

<p>During his stay, he visited the camps and spent some
time at the target range, which had been installed under
the direction of Major Eldredge. The General tried his
hand at shooting, and received an excellent score card
from Lieutenant Craig, who was in charge of the range.
His visit was made the occasion of a reception and ball
given at the theatre, by all the officers of the Garrison.
This ball was the social function of the season, and was in
acknowledgment of the many courtesies extended to the
officers by the citizens of Matanzas.</p>

<p>The Twelfth New York was the first Volunteer Regiment
to leave Matanzas. When the transport which was
to carry it home, arrived in the bay, the band of the
Eighth paraded through the line officers street, and company
after company fell in and marched to the camp of
the Twelfth to show the good feeling existing between the
regiments. While marching over the band played "On
the Bowery." As the column passed through the camp of
the Twelfth, its band got together and joined the band
of the Eighth on the march back, playing "Home, Sweet
Home." The men of the two regiments fell in together
behind the bands, and after marching through both camps,
halted in the open space between the camps while the
bands played "Auld Lang Syne."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>On March 21st the Eighth, after evening parade, escorted
the Twelfth New York to the wharf, where it
embarked in lighters to go on board the transport "Meade",
which sailed the following day.</p>

<p>On March 27th, orders were issued for the Eighth to be
mustered out in Boston. On April 2nd, the transport
"Meade" returned from New York, and the Eighth was
ordered to embark the following day. In the evening the
officers, with the band, called upon General Sanger to pay
respects for the last time to their chief. During most of
their service, they had served in his command. They appreciated
the efforts he had made to maintain their health,
and held in high esteem his qualities as an officer and
soldier.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of April 3rd the post flag was lowered
in the camp of the Eighth, and the regiment, numbering
46 officers and 1177 men, embarked. Early the next
morning the transport steamed out of Matanzas Bay, and
the foreign service of the regiment was ended.</p>

<p>Just before sailing, a messenger from the Municipal
Government of Matanzas presented the Colonel with an
official copy of a proclamation, which had been adopted
and issued by the city the preceding day.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p class="center">"TO THE EIGHTH REGIMENT OF
MASSACHUSETTS.</p>

<p>The brief period which you have spent among us has
been sufficient to enable us to appreciate your patriotism,

you leave stamped upon our hearts. You are worthy sons

<p class="drop-cap">The trip to Boston was uneventful, except that
sea sickness among the cooks and the novelty
of handling rations on board ship, somewhat
disarranged the commissary department.</p>

<p>Early Sunday morning, April 9th, Boston Light was
sighted. At quarantine, Governor Wolcott boarded the ship
bringing the welcome of the Commonwealth. In the afternoon
the regiment disembarked at the New England docks,
and marched to the South Armory. A salute was tendered
the Mayor at City Hall, and the Governor at the State
House. There was a tremendous outpouring of people to
welcome the troops, and their demonstration was magnificent.
The soldiers marching with <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'rythmic swing'">rhythmic swing</ins> and
perfect alignment, and their brown, hearty and healthy
appearance, testified to the drill and discipline they had
undergone during their term of service. The regiment
was furloughed to report at the South Armory on April
12th, and the companies were dismissed to their home stations,
where they were received with great demonstrations
of joy and many impromptu celebrations.</p>

<p>On April 12th the companies reported in Boston. The
men were quartered in the South Armory. There was
practically nothing for them to do except guard duty and
evening parade on Boston Common. This parade daily
attracted a large crowd of spectators. The clerical force of
each company however, was busy on the muster out rolls,
and the quartermaster's department was straightening out
its accounts with the government, and getting ready for
the final reckoning.</p>

<p>On April 19th the men were dismissed to report on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
April 28th, which was the day selected for mustering out
the regiment.</p>

<p>A day or so previous to muster out a change occurred in
the commissioned officers of the regiment. Captain Jacob
C. R. Peabody of Company H, resigned to accept a position
on General Ludlow's staff. First Lieutenant Augustus
G. Reynolds was promoted to captain of the company,
and Second Lieutenant William F. Young of Company D
became first lieutenant of Company H, while Color Sergeant
William F. Marston of Company G was commissioned
a second lieutenant in Company D.</p>

<p>On the morning of April 28th the Eighth reported for
its last day of duty. It did not take long to set the wheels
of mustering out in motion. Every man discharged was
given two months extra pay. One hundred eight thousand
dollars in gold and silver representing the amount due the
men was paid out. There was a large crowd present
from all the towns represented by the companies. Captain
Erastus M. Weaver officiated as mustering out officer. It
took about half an hour to muster out each company, and
the work was completed by 5.30.</p>

<p>At the time of muster out, the roster of the regiment
was as follows, numerous changes having taken place during
its term of service.</p>

<p>With the muster out of Colonel Pew, the Eighth Regiment
Massachusetts Infantry, U. S. V., ceased to exist,
after just a year's service, reckoning from the day the rolls
were opened for volunteers. It was in the service longer
than any other regiment from Massachusetts, and while
it never took part in a battle or skirmish, its record
stands second to no other volunteer regiment in the service
of the United States.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">No fault could be found by the members of the
regiment with the receptions they received
upon the return of the companies to the home
stations. Although it was Sunday night, the
enthusiasm knew no bounds, and in most places a large
procession awaited the arrival of the company, took it under
escort and started for the armory. Later, in most
every place, official receptions were held, but they lacked
the spontaneous enthusiasm which marked the welcome
home on the arrival of the companies from the South Armory,
Boston.</p>

<p>As these receptions took place within the year covered
by the service of the regiment, it seems fitting that a brief
account of them should find a place in this history of the
organization.</p>

<p>Company A of Newburyport reached home about 9.15
o'clock, but its coming had been announced some two hours
previously, by the sounding of the militia call on the fire
alarm, consequently there was a tremendous crowd at the
station, which gave the command a rousing cheer as the
men stepped from the train.</p>

<p>A delegation of paraders were awaiting the arrival of
the company and the line was soon formed in the following
order; Newburyport Cadet Band; Mayor Huse and
members of the city government; Company L, Massachusetts
Naval Brigade; National Band of Newburyport;
Company A, Eighth Massachusetts Infantry, U. S. V.;
Newburyport fire department; Newburyport Bicycle club
and Shields Division, A. O. H. The line of march led
through the principal streets which were packed with people
who cheered and burned red fire as the company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
passed. Wolfe tavern was finally reached, and there the
festivities of the evening ended with a supper served the
members of the company.</p>

<p>On April 23, Company A was officially entertained at
a banquet which was spread in the armory and to which
some 400 people sat down. Mayor Huse presided at the
after dinner exercises and there was speaking by prominent
citizens.</p>

<p>The Amesbury company, Company B, arrived from
Boston at 9.40 o'clock and found a large crowd waiting
its arrival, the fire alarm having sounded the warning of
the company's approach. All the business houses were
brilliantly illuminated and a salute was fired as the train
rolled into the station. A parade was formed and passed
through the principal streets in the following order;
Drum corps; veterans of Company B; E. P. Wallace Post
122, G. A. R.; high school battalion; the fire department
and Company B, Eighth Massachusetts Infantry, U. S. V.</p>

<p>The official welcome home took place on April 26th,
when there was a public reception to the members of the
company from 4 to 6 o'clock at Armory Hall, followed by
a big banquet in the evening, at which time Commander
Charles E. Kennard of Post 122, G. A. R. presided and
speeches were made by prominent townspeople.</p>

<p>The Grand Army post, headed by a drum corps, and
hundreds of the people of Marblehead were at the station
to welcome home Company C and gave the members a
rousing reception. The company was escorted to Abbot
Hall, where H. C. Sparhawk, chairman of the board of
selectmen welcomed them home in the name of the town,
and Captain Pettengill and Lieutenant Whelpley responded
for the company. The men were then dismissed.</p>

<p>On April 14th, the town was alive with bunting and en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>thusiasm,
for this was the day of the official welcoming. A
big parade was a feature of the day, the line being formed
in the following order: Thomas Swasey, chief marshal,
and staff; Excelsior Drum Corps; John Goodwin Post,
G. A. R., barge containing crippled Civil War veterans;
cannon captured by the U. S. S. Marblehead at Fort Cayo
del Torei; Cuban mine pulled up at Guantanamo by the
Marblehead, on drays; Company C, Eighth Massachusetts
Infantry, U. S. V.; officers of the fire department in carriages;
Pickett Veteran Firemen's Association; Lafayette
Brass Band of Salem; members of fire department;
Phenix Veteran Firemen's Association; apparatus of the
fire department; Thorner's Rough Riders. There was an
exhibition drill by Company C, a supper and reception.
The day's exercises wound up at Abbot Hall, where
Henry C. Sparhawk, of the board of selectmen presided,
and speeches were made by various people. Among the
incidents of the day was the presentation of a button to
every member of the company by the Volunteer Aid
Association, through its president, Mrs. Mary E. Graves.</p>

<p>Central Square, Lynn, was black with people awaiting
the home-coming of the members of Companies D and I
of that city, and every train which passed through with
companies aboard, bound homeward, was greeted with
loud cheers. Finally, the Lynn companies arrived, and
the air was rent with cheers, and excitement was at a high
pitch. Cannon boomed and red fire was burned in quantities.
Mayor Shepard had met the company at Boston,
and found that it was the wish of the men to go directly
home, so beyond this outburst of enthusiasm, nothing was
done in the way of a welcome, the companies marching
directly to the armory, and the men were there dismissed.</p>

<p>On April 13th, however, Lynn people officially received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the companies in a manner which will not soon be forgotten.
The city was bedecked with bunting, and thousands
crowded the streets through which the parade passed, and
cheered to the echo the returned war veterans. The parade
was formed in the following order: General Charles C.
Frye, chief marshal, and staff; Lynn Brass Band; General
Lander Post, No. 5, G. A. R.; Lieutenant-Colonel Mudge
Camp, Sons of Veterans; Lynn Light Infantry Veteran
Association; Wooldredge Cadet Veterans; Lynn Cadet
Band; English High School Battalion; Classical High
School Battalion; carriages containing Mayor Shepard,
and members of the city government; Eighth Massachusetts
Infantry; U. S. V. Band; Company I, Eighth Massachusetts
Infantry, U. S. V.; Company D, Eighth Massachusetts
Infantry, U. S. V.; Veterans of Company E,
Massachusetts Naval Brigade; Veterans of the Spanish
War. A banquet at the State Armory followed, at which
time 800 plates were laid and Mayor Shepard acted as
toastmaster, and speeches were made by many prominent
people, both in military and civil life.</p>

<p>Mayor Benjamin D. Webber, of Beverly, went to Boston
as soon as he heard that the Transport Meade was in, and
together with other prominent citizens went down the harbor
to welcome the members of Company E. A specially
chartered tug was used. Learning that the company was to
come home that night, he telephoned to Beverly the fact,
and upon the arrival of Company E at the station, a large
gathering of people was on hand and welcomed the command
with three rousing cheers. A parade was formed,
consisting of a Drum Corps, Post 89, G. A. R., and John
Low Camp, Sons of Veterans, and the line of march taken
up for the armory, where there were short speeches, followed
by a collation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The official celebration in honor of the return of the volunteers
took place on April 11th, when a parade was
formed in the following order: Captain W. E. Perry,
chief marshal, and staff; Beverly Cadet Band; John H.
Chipman Post, 89, G. A. R.; John Low Camp, Sons of
Veterans; Preston Post, 188, G. A. R; Charles Haddock
Camp, Sons of Veterans; barouches containing disabled
Civil War veterans and Mayor Webber and members of
the city government; Lynn Brass Band; Company E,
Eighth Massachusetts Infantry, U. S. V.; Beverly fire
department, apparatus and men; Bass River Lodge, I. O.
O. F.; letter carriers; Excelsior Drum Corps; Golden
Star Council, O. U. A. M.; Young Men's Catholic Temperance
Society; Ancient Order of Hibernians; Bass River
Court of Forresters; carriages containing members of
Roger Conant Council, Royal Arcanum, and Beverly
Lodge, Knights of Pythias; four-horse drag with members
of Jubilee Yacht Club; carriages containing citizens.</p>

<p>After the parade, the members of the company enjoyed
a New England boiled dinner at the armory, and in the
evening attended exercises at the City Hall. Mayor
Webber presided, speeches were made by representative
citizens, and the school children sang patriotic songs.</p>

<p>On the evening of April 28th, the members of the company
were tendered a banquet at City Hall, Mayor
Webber making a speech of welcome and presiding the
remainder of the evening, during which various prominent
citizens responded to toasts. The galleries were filled with
people, they having been thrown open to the public.</p>

<p>Company F, of Haverhill, arrived home rather unexpectedly
at 8.15 P. M., but Mayor Chase was awake
and the city was not caught napping. There was a good-sized
crowd present at the depot, and it enlarged every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
minute, so that by the time the parade moved, the streets
were filled with a shouting, cheering people. The parade
formed as follows: Haverhill City Band; Major How
Post, 47, G. A. R.; General Burnside Command, Veterans'
Union; Provisional Company, State Militia; Eighth
Regiment Drum Corps; Company F, Eighth Massachusetts
Infantry, U. S. V.; carriages containing Mayor
Chase and members of the city government.</p>

<p>It was 11.15 P. M. before the members of Company G
returned once more to Gloucester. For several hours a
crowd had awaited their coming at the depot, the military
call on the fire alarm having notified the citizens that the
company was on its way home. Although the hour was
late, there was plenty of enthusiasm, and salutes were
fired and red fire burned. A parade was formed, made up
in the following order: Gloucester Band; Massachusetts
Naval Brigade, mounted detachment of citizens; Colonel
Allen Post 45, G. A. R.; Company G, Eighth Massachusetts
Infantry, U. S. V.; delegations from the various fire
companies; Wingaersheek Band; Wingaersheek Tribe of
Red Men; Gloucester Council Knights of Columbus; Portuguese
Acoriana Society; carriages containing prominent
citizens.</p>

<p>On April 14th, the official celebration took place, when
a big parade passed through the principal streets of the
city, in the following order: Fitz E. Oaks, chief marshal,
and staff; Gloucester Band; Company M, Massachusetts
Naval Brigade; High School Cadet Battalion; Colonel
Allen Post 45, G. A. R.; Eighth Massachusetts Infantry,
U. S. V. Band; Company G, Eighth Massachusetts Infantry,
U. S. V.; members of the fire department; J. Franklin
Dyer Camp, Sons of Veterans; Hutchinson's Military
Band; Ocean Lodge, I. O. O. F.; Wingaersheek Tribe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Red Men; Fernwood Lodge, A. O. U. W.; Gloucester
Council, Knights of Columbus; St. Angelo Council,
Knights of Malta; Acoriana Beneficiary Society; carriages
containing distinguished citizens; mounted men.</p>

<p>In the evening there was a big banquet, at which time
Judge Taft presided and there were speeches by men in
the public life of Gloucester, and men in military circles.</p>

<p>When Company H, of Salem, reached home, it found
thousands of people awaiting its return. The churches
had dismissed their congregations that the members might
unite with the other citizens in a royal welcoming of the
soldier boys. Red fire was burned freely and there were
salutes. At the station, a big parade awaited the volunteers,
and taking the company under escort, marched to the
Armory, where the men were dismissed. The parade was
as follows: Salem Cadet Band; Second Corps Cadets,
M. V. M.; Phil H. Sheridan Post 34, G. A. R.; postal
clerks and carriers; Salem Light Infantry Veteran Association;
Mayor James H. Turner and members of the city
government; Army and Navy League; Company H,
Eighth Massachusetts Infantry, U. S. V. The fire alarm
had sounded an agreed upon signal, which gave those intending
to parade time enough to gather at the various
headquarters. Mayor Turner had met the company in
Boston and made the arrangements for the affair.</p>

<p>Tuesday, April 11th, was the day set aside for the
official celebration, and the streets were lined with thousands,
who cheered and shouted, but it was not the spontaneous
outburst that had been given the company when
it first arrived home.</p>

<p>The parade passed through the principal streets of the
city, and was made up as follows: Colonel Samuel A.
Johnson, chief marshal, and staff; Salem Cadet Band;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Second Corps Cadets, M. V. M.; Phil H. Sheridan Post
34, G. A. R.; Army and Navy League; Lieutenant-Colonel
Henry Merritt Camp, Sons of Veterans; carriages containing
disabled members of the G. A. R., and Mayor Turner
and members of the city government; National Guards
Band; Salem Light Infantry Veteran Association; Company
H, Eighth Massachusetts Infantry, U. S. V.; Salem
Brass Band; Salem Letter Carriers and Postal clerks;
Salem Fire Department; Salem Veteran Firemen's Association;
Salem Drum Corps; Father Mathews Total Abstinence
Society; St. Joseph's Benefit Society; street department
drivers, mounted.</p>

<p>In the evening the Salem Light Infantry Veteran
Association tendered a banquet to the volunteers in the
armory at the Franklin building. Captain John P. Reynolds
acted as toastmaster, and a number of distinguished
citizens and military guests responded to the toasts.</p>

<p>The West Peabody Brass Band, Ward Post 90, G. A.
R. and ex-members of Company K, were found waiting
at the depot by the members of Company K of Danvers,
when they stepped from the train. Line was immediately
formed and through a lane of red fire and cheering citizens,
the company marched to the armory, partook of a
lunch and then separated for their homes.</p>

<p>On April 11 the town officially received her sons back
from the Spanish war with a parade, reception and banquet.
The parade formed in the following order: Chief
Marshal F. U. French and staff; cavalcade of citizens;
West Peabody Brass Band; Ward Post 90, G. A. R.;
carriages containing the selectmen and guests; Company
K, Eighth Massachusetts Infantry, U. S. V.; ex-members
of Company K and citizens; school children.</p>

<p>After the parade a reception was in progress at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Town Hall for two hours, after which the line was re-formed
and the party proceeded to the armory, where a
fine banquet was served, followed by speeches from prominent
townspeople and guests, M. C. Pettengill acting as
presiding officer.</p>

<p>Mayor Eaton went to Boston, met the members of Company
L, and telephoned word back to Lawrence that the
company was coming home. The fire alarm was immediately
blown and as at the other places, the company was
met by a big crowd at the depot, and a procession to escort
it to its armory. Battery C, M. V. M. fired a salute as
the train rolled into the station. The parade formed in
the following order: Colonel Donovan, chief marshal;
band; Battery C, M. V. M.; Company F, Ninth Infantry,
M. V. M.; Colonel Sargeant camp, Sons of Veterans;
band; Needham Post 39, G. A. R.; drum corps; seven fire
companies; Gratton Guards; citizens committee; Company
L, Eighth Massachusetts Infantry, U. S. V.; city government
and citizens in carriages. The parade marched
directly to the armory, where the volunteers were dismissed.</p>

<p>Through a misunderstanding on the part of somebody,
there was no one to welcome home the members of Company
M, at Somerville, and when they arrived at the
armory they found the place locked and deserted. Finally
the police were secured and the doors forced open
and the command marched inside. After giving three
cheers for the city and the company, the men were dismissed.</p>

<p>Somerville citizens more than made up for the lack of
cordiality on the night of the return home, by the enthusiastic
reception they gave the company and other Somerville
volunteers at the official welcome home which took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
place on April 19. The principal part of the day's
programme was a big parade, which moved through the
principal streets, packed with cheering people, in the following
order: Chief Marshal, F. DeWitt Lapham and
staff; platoon of 20 members of the National Lancers, M.
V. M.; First Regiment Band; company of letter carriers;
Bunker Hill Cadet Band; Bunker Hill Guards, Division
37, A. O. H.; Davitt Guards, Division 40, A. O. H.;
Knights of Sacred Heart Drum Corps; Knights of Sacred
Heart; Somerville Veteran Firemen's Association; T. F.
Meagher Drum Corps; W. C. Kingsley Post 139, G. A.
R.; Company M, Eighth Massachusetts Infantry, U. S.
V.; unattached soldiers and sailors; carriages containing
city officials and guests.</p>

<p>Following the parade, the company and invited guests
were given light refreshments at Bow Street hall, after
which many speeches were made, Alderman Wilson acting
as presiding officer.</p>

<p>In the evening, at 6 o'clock, the company was banquetted
in Beacon hall, where plates were spread for a large gathering.
After the banquet had been enjoyed, Alderman
Wilson, who again acted as chairman, rapped for order
and speeches followed by prominent city officials and
guests.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">In every war the percentage of deaths from disease
is greater than of deaths on the battlefield,
and the Spanish war was no exception.
Of the hundreds of Massachusetts young men
who volunteered and answered the call of President
McKinley for troops, 292 were called upon to sacrifice
their lives for their country.</p>

<p>Of this number, but nine were killed or died of wounds
on the battlefield, the remaining 283 dying of disease or
meeting death in an accidental manner.</p>

<p>The First Massachusetts Heavy Artillery lost one man
during its term of service; the Second Massachusetts Infantry
had nine killed or died of wounds received in
battle and 89 died of disease; the Fifth Massachusetts
Infantry lost nine men during its term of service; the
Sixth Massachusetts Infantry lost 26 men during its term
of service; the Eighth Massachusetts Infantry lost 31 men,
and the Ninth Massachusetts Infantry 125 men. The Naval
Brigade, during its term of service, lost two men,
making the total number of men who were killed, died of
wounds or disease, 292.</p>

<p>Of this number, as the foregoing list will show, the
Eighth Massachusetts Infantry contributed the lives of
one officer and 30 enlisted men, to which might be added
the name of Private Charles A. Currier of Company B,
who died soon after being transferred to the Hospital
Corps, U. S. A.</p>

<p>The great majority of these men died in the hospitals
in the south, far from home and friends. They gave up
their lives willingly to their country's cause, and who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
there to say that theirs was not as much a hero's death as
that of the men who fell while bravely charging through
the Cuban jungles or up the steep slope of San Juan Hill.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">During the year of service in the volunteers
1465 names were borne upon the rolls of the
Eighth Massachusetts Regiment. This does
not necessarily mean that 1465 different men
were connected with the regiment, for that was not so, for
some of the men's names appear upon the rolls twice, such
as when an enlisted man was promoted to be an officer, or
when an officer was transferred from one company to another,
or an enlisted man transferred from a company to
the regimental band.</p>

<p>The following figures will no doubt be of interest to
the men who served in the regiment.</p>

<p>Of the officers of the regiment 46 were mustered out
with the regiment, 12 resigned and were discharged, one
died, one was discharged by reason of promotion outside
the regiment, and four were discharged for promotion in

<p>Of the enlisted men, 1161 were mustered out, 53 were
discharged for disability, 5 were discharged because they
were minors, 2 were discharged (no reason given), 51
were discharged by order, (the majority for physical unfitness),
11 were discharged for promotion; 6 were dishonorably
discharged; 71 were discharged by reason of

<p>By the foregoing it will be seen that Company B of
Amesbury had the largest number of entries upon its rolls
during the year, 127, while Company F of Haverhill had
the smallest, 113. Company E of Beverly was the only
company which did not have a death among its members
during the term of service.</p>

<p>There were ten states and eighty-nine cities and towns
represented in the regiment, according to the residences
as given upon the muster out roll on file at the Adjutant-General's
office, at the State House.</p>

<p>The ten states were Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Rhode Island, New York, Ohio, Minnesota,
Pennsylvania and Georgia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The cities and towns represented, and the number of
men furnished the regiment by each, are as follows:</p>

Newburyport 101; Somerville 99; Amesbury 96; Gloucester
95; Marblehead 74; Beverly 72, and Danvers 45.
These eleven places represent the home stations of the
companies comprising the regiment; Lynn, of course, furnishing
two companies to the command.</p>

<p>The other places represented in the regiment were as
follows: Peabody 19; Boston 20; Lowell 19; Cambridge

<p>On the following pages will be found a complete roster
of the regiment, containing the name of every man who
served in the regiment during its year of service.</p>

<p>The record of each man is a copy of that contained in
the muster out roll, now on file at the Adjutant General's
office, State House, Boston, Mass.</p>

<p>The greatest possible care has been taken to avoid
errors, and in only one case was a change made in a man's
record. Upon the muster out roll the man was charged
with being a deserter and also with having been discharged
honorably. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'After consulation'">After consultation</ins> with the company
commander, it was decided that the man should be given
the benefit of an honorable discharge, especially as he was
not classified as a deserter in the summary at the end of
the company roll.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that two men, both of whom were
former members of the First Massachusetts Heavy Artil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>lery
are credited as enlisting from Americus, Georgia.
This is so stated upon the muster out roll, and consequently
is so printed. They were probably mustered into the
regiment in the Georgia town, hence the reason for being
credited to it. In a few cases the date of transfer of a
man from a company to the band does not agree, one date
being recorded on the band roll and another on the company
roll. This is sometimes true as to his place of residence,
but the muster out rolls were followed in these
cases.</p>

<p>The full record of the men transferred to the Reserve
Ambulance company, U. S. A., or the Hospital Corps, U.
S. A., has been added to the record. Their record on the
muster out roll ends with the day of their transfer from
the regiment, but it was thought best to publish their full
service record, which was secured from the War Department,
through the courtesy of Hon. A. P. Gardner, representative
in Congress from the Sixth Massachusetts
district.</p>

<p>The following letters will be of interest to the members

regiment and its commander had with officers higher in

retained 10 years later.</p>

<p><em>Sir</em>:&mdash;I take pleasure in saying that I have known
Colonel William A. Pew, Jr., Eighth Massachusetts
Volunteers, since his entry into the service at Camp
Thomas. He has served with me in Kentucky, Georgia,
and in this Island, and has shown himself to be in every
way competent to command his regiment, which is one of
the best I have seen in the Army. Colonel Pew is a
lawyer by profession, but has devoted himself very persistently
to the National Guard, with which he has served
some eighteen or twenty years. Withal, he is still in the
prime of life, and should occasion require it, I should be
glad to see you avail of his services for the Regular Army,
or any further service that may be necessary in the volunteers.
Colonel Pew is entirely capable, correct in his
habits, soldierly in his bearing, and at all times attentive
to his duties. You could not do better, if his services
were required, than appoint him to the rank of Brigadier
General, which grade I am sure he would have won had
it been his good fortune to participate in the conflict with
the enemy.</p>

<p>I cordially commend him for the above promotion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
bespeak your good opinion of him, such officers as he will
commend to your notice, and the regiment itself.</p>

<p><em>Sir</em>:&mdash;I have the honor to recommend for appointment
as Brigadier General of Volunteers, Colonel William A.
Pew, of the Eighth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.
Colonel Pew has been under my command since last June
and has proved his capacity in many ways. He has been
at times during this interval, in command of a brigade,
and also of the Third Division, First Army Corps. He
has one of the best regiments in the service in all respects,
due largely to his intelligence and faithful service. I
consider him fully qualified to discharge the duties of
Brigadier General.</p>

<p><em>My dear Sir</em>:&mdash;Replying to your letter of October 19th,
I hasten to say that the Eighth Massachusetts Infantry
served under my command during the war with Spain.
It was a most excellent volunteer regiment, exceedingly
well officered, from Colonel Pew down to the lowest
lieutenant. It was noted for the good discipline displayed
by it throughout its entire service, and what struck
me particularly were the good relations existing between the
officers and the enlisted men at all times and in all places.
It was quite apparent that the officers treated their men
with just consideration, equally removed from undue
familiarity on the one hand and oppressive severity on
the other. They took every care to instruct their men in
all their duties, and while the regiment did not participate
in any battle, it showed by its promptitude and willing
obedience to orders, that it would give a good account
of itself in the presence of the enemy. Its camps were
noted for their cleanliness and good police, and both
officers and men for the cheerful intelligence with which
they performed such duties as were assigned to them. In
the late war between the States, it was said that Massachusetts
sent her best to support the Union, and judging
from the character of this regiment, it is safe to say that
she did the same in the war against Spain.</p>

<p class="right padr8">Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Mr. H. E. Webber</span>, Salem, Mass.</p>

<p><em>Dear Sir</em>:&mdash;Your letter of the 23rd inst. received. I
remember the arrival of the Eighth Massachusetts Regiment
at Camp George H. Thomas, Chickamauga Park,
Georgia, and assigned it on report of its colonel to the
Second Brigade, Third Division, First Army Corps.
Colonel W. A. Pew, Jr., commanded this regiment at that
time, and afterwards served under my command in Cuba.
I can say that I thought very highly of the regiment. It
was in good discipline, well instructed, good soldiers in
fact, and it gives me pleasure to bear this testimony
through the regiment, its officers and soldiers.</p>

<p class="pad10">I am, Sir,</p>
<p class="right padr6">Very truly yours,</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
